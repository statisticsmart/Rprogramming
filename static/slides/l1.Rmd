- R is a software environment for statistical computing and graphics

- Language designers: **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand

- Parent language: S

- The latest R version 3.6.2 has been released on 2019-12-12

## R and RStudio

"If R were **an airplane**, RStudio would be **the airport**, providing many, many supporting services that make it easier for you, the pilot, to take off and go to awesome places. Sure, you can fly an airplane without an airport, but having those runways and supporting infrastructure is a game-changer."

## R Console

```{r, comment=NA}
7+1

```



```{r, comment=NA}
rnorm(10) 

```

--

## Variable assignment

```{r, comment=NA}
a <- rnorm(10)
a
```

--

```{r, comment=NA}
b <- a*100
b
```

---



# Data permanency

- `ls()` can be used to display the names of the objects which are currently stored within R.

- The collection of objects currently stored is called the **workspace**

```{r, comment=NA}
ls()

```

--
- To remove objects the function `rm` is available

    - remove all objects `rm(list=ls())`
    
    - remove specific objects `rm(x, y, z)`
    
    
```{r, comment=NA}
rm(a)
ls()
```

```{r, comment=NA}
rm(list=ls())
ls()
```

## Comment your code

- Each line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol and a single space: # . 

```{r, comment=NA}
rnorm(10) # This is a comment 
sum(1:10) # 1+2
```

---

## Style Guide

- Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread.  -- Hadley Wickham

```{r, comment=NA}
sum(1:10)#Bad commenting style
sum(1:10) # Good commenting style

```

- Also, use commented lines of - and = to break up your file into easily readable sub-sections.

```r
# Read data ----------------

# Plot data ----------------
```

## Objects in R

- R is an [object-oriented language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).

--
- An object in R is anything (data structures, functions, etc., that can be assigned to a variable).

--

Let's take a look of some common types of objects.

--

1. .red[Data structures] are the ways of arranging data.

    - You can create objects, using the left pointing arrow <-
--
1. .red[Functions] tell R to do something.

    - A function may be applied to an object.

    - Result of applying a function is usually an object too.

    - All function calls need to be followed by parentheses.

```{r, comment=NA}
a <- 1:20 # data structure
sum(a) # sum is a function applied on a

```

```r
help.start() # Some functions work on their own.
```
---

# Getting help with functions and features

- R has inbuilt help facility


### Method 1

```r
help(rnorm)
```

- For a feature specified by special characters such as `for`, `if`, `[[`

```r
help("[[")
```

- Search the help files for a word or phrase.

```r
help.search(‘weighted mean’) 
```

### Method 2

```r
?rnorm
```

```r
??rnorm
```

- How they are created

- Structural complexity

# 1. Vectors

---

# Vectors

- Vectors are one-dimensional arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data.

- Combine function c() is used to form the vector.

- Data in a vector must only be one type or mode (numeric, character, or logical). You can’t mix modes in the same vector.


## Vector assignment

```r
x <- c(5, 6, 3, 1 , 100)
```

- assignment operator ('<-'), '=' can be used as an alternative.

- `c()` function

.red[What will be the output of the following code?]

```r
y <- c(x, 500, 600)
```

---
# Generating regular sequences

Integer sequence

```{r}
2:6
```

```{r}
seq(2, 3, by=0.5)
```

Repeat a vector

```{r}
rep(1:2, times=3)
```

Repeat elements of a vector

```{r}
rep(1:2, each=3)
```

---
## Vector arithmetic

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- c(5, 6, 3, 1 , 100)
y <- c(x, 500, 600)

```

```{r}
y+2
```

---

The operations are performed element by element

.red[What will be the output of the following code?]

```r
first <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
second <- c(10, 100)
first * second
```

# How to create this type of beautiful graphs? Let's discuss this at 



---

# Types

Integers or floating point numbers

```{r}
vec1 <- c(1.2, 1.5, 1.6)
class(vec1)
```

Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE)

```{r}
vec2 <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
class(vec2)
```

Character strings

```{r}
vec3 <- c("male", "male", "female")
class(vec3)

# 2. Matrices
---
# Matrix operations

Create a matrix

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, ncol=3); x
```

Select a row/column

```{r}
x[1, ] # select the 1st row
```


```{r}
x[, 1] # select the 1st column
```

Select an element

```{r}
x[2, 3]
```
---

# Matrix operations (cont.)

Transpose

```{r}
t(x)
```

Matrix multiplication

```{r}
y <- matrix(seq(10, 60, by=10), nrow=3)
z <- x %*% y
z
```

Find x in: m*x=n

```r
solve(m, n)
```
