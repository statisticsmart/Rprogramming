## Penalties for late submission of assignments

- Each assignment write-up will indicate the deadline for on-time submission. The date and time of the deadline are firm.

--

- Submitting by the deadline earns the on-time bonus marks. The assignment write-up will specify the bonus if available.

--

- If you miss the deadline, there may be a grace period for late submissions. The assignment write-up will specify if there is a grace period and how long. You can make a late submission after the deadline and up to the end of the grace period. A penalty is applied for late submissions and the late submissions do not earn the on-time bonus. 

--

- Late submission penalty

|  Time |  Penalty | On-time bonus  |
|---|:-:|:-:|
| 1 - 2 days  | 0  |  0 |
| 3 - 7 days | -0.5  |  0 |
| 8 - grace period  | -1  |  0 |


- **Submissions are not accepted beyond the grace period.** The grace period is strictly enforced.



---

## Extensions of time for submission

Category A

- An illness that requires the student to miss all of his or her classes for 2 days or more.

Category B

- A period of grief for loss of a family member or friend.

Category C

- A family emergency.



**A valid documentation of proof is required prior to the assignment deadline.**
---

## Philosophy driving our late policy has three goals


- Keep things fair.

- Encourage good time-management.

- Encouragement and appreciation of on time submission students.

---

# Assignment

## How to deal with emergencies like a computer breakdown?

 - Please inform the lecturer-in-charge in advance.

 - Submit handwritten assignment: Write the solution you would take if you have an access to a computer. You should write all necessary steps and give reasons wherever necessary and submit the assignment.
 
 - You will be asked to submit the computer-based outputs at a later date.
