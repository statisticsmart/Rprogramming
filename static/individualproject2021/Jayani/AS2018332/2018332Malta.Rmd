# **1.  INTRODUCTION**

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Malta is a southern European country and consists of an archipelago. It is situated centrally in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Sicily, Italy.It lies 80 km (50 mi) south of Italy, 284 km (176 mi) east of Tunisia, and 333 km (207 mi) north of Libya. Malta's geographic position between the European Union region and Africa makes it a target for immigration. The government system is a republic; the chief of state is the president, and the head of government is the prime minister.

### **1.2.  Climate condition in Malta**

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Malta enjoys a Mediterranean climate, with sea temperatures higher than in any other part of Europe. The Maltese Islands have a pleasantly sunny climate with a daily average of around 12 hours sunshine in summer going down to 5 to 6 hours in mid-winter. The average yearly temperature is around 23 °C (73 °F) during the day and 16 °C (61 °F) at night. In the capital, Valletta, the average temperature ranges from 12.5 °C (54.5 °F) in February to 27 °C (81 °F) in August. </p>

Summers are hot, dry and very sunny. Day-time temperatures in summer are often mitigated by cooling sea breezes. 

Spring and autumn are cooler, except when the occasional Scirocco wind from Africa brings unseasonally high temperatures and humidity.

Winters are mild, with the occasional short cold spells brought about by the north and north-easterly winds from central Europe.

Annual rainfall is low, averaging 568mm a year. Bathing in the sea is quite possible well into the ‘winter’ months, and the peak beach season can last until mid- to late October.

### **1.3.  COVID-19 pandemic in Malta and Timeline**

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The COVID-19 pandemic in Malta is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of the disease in Malta was an Italian 12-year-old girl on 7 March 2020. The girl and her family were in isolation, as required by those following the Maltese health authority's guidelines who were in Italy or other highly infected countries. Later, both her parents were found positive as well. </p>

On 23 March, the total number of confirmed cases in the country crossed over 100 as another seventeen new cases were reported.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>

# **2.  Exploratory Data Analysis**


### **2.1.  Visualization of death, confirmed, recovered, active cases**

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
malta_corona <- coronavirus %>% filter(country == "Malta")
# To remove the negative values of the data set
malta_corona1 <- malta_corona %>% mutate(cases = replace (cases, which(cases < 0),0))
malta_corona <- coronavirus %>% filter(country == "Malta")
# To remove the null values of the data set
malta_corona1[is.na(malta_corona1)]=0
view(malta_corona1)
```
#### **Summery of Covid-19 Data in Malta**
```{r,message=FALSE,fig.align = 'center',(echo = TRUE)} 
summary(malta_corona1)
```

This summery is consisted with the number of confirmed, death and recovered corona cases from 22nd January 2020 to 18th September 2021 of the country Malta

#### **Extract recovered cases in the Malta**
```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
recover_corona <- malta_corona1 %>% filter(type=="recovered")
ggplot(recover_corona, aes(x=date, y=cases)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Malta: Daily Covid-19 Recovered cases")
```
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
According to the plot we can see that there is only few recovered cases were reported until the August 2020. After that we can see clearly that number of daily recovered cases has increased until March 2020. It has been reached near 400 daily recovered cases. After end of March there was a rapid decrease in daily confirmd cases untill April 2021. Again it rapidly increased to 300 daily confirmed cases during the month of August 2021 and after that it rapidly decreases again.
</p>


#### **Extract confirmed cases in the Malta**
```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
confirm_corona <- malta_corona1 %>% filter(type=="confirmed")
ggplot(confirm_corona, aes(x=date, y=cases)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Malta: Daily Covid-19 Confirmed cases")
```
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
According to the plot we can see that there is only few confirmed cases were reported until the end of  July 2020. After that we can see clearly that number of confirmed cases has increased by daily until March 2020. In March there has been a significant increase and it has been reached 500 daily confirmed cases. After middle of March there was a rapid decrease in daily confirmd cases untill July 2021. Again it rapidly increased to 200 daily confirmed cases during the month of July 2021
</p>

#### **Extract death cases in the Malta**
```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
death_corona <- malta_corona1 %>% filter(type=="death")
ggplot(death_corona, aes(x=date, y=cases)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Malta: Daily Covid-19 death cases")
```
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
According to figure there were no coronavirus death records in Malta until the month of April 2020. Then we can see that there is only few death cases were reported. After that we can see clearly that number of daily death cases has rapidly increased and it has been reached near 7 daily death cases in November 2020. After that from middle of March 2021, it has been decreased again.
</p>

#### **Extract Active cases in the Malta**
```{r}
new_malta <- malta_corona1 %>% pivot_wider(names_from=type, values_from=cases)
new_malta$active <- new_malta$confirmed - new_malta$death - new_malta$recovered
# To remove the negative values of the data set
malta_active <- new_malta %>% mutate(active = replace (active, which(active < 0),0))
# To remove the null values of the data set
malta_active[is.na(malta_active)]=0

ggplot(malta_active, aes(x=date, y=active)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Malta: Daily Covid-19 Active cases")
```

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
According to figure there were no coronavirus active cases in Malta until the month of March 2020. Then we can see that there is only few active cases were reported. After that we can see clearly that number of active cases has rapidly increased and it has been reached near 250 daily active cases in March 2021. After that it has been decreased again. Then it has been increased again in July 2021.
</p>

##### **Daily Covid-19 cases by type**
```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
ggplot(malta_corona1, aes(x=date, y = cases, color = type)) + geom_path(size = 0.5) + ggtitle("Malta: Daily Covid-19 cases by type")
```
```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
ggplot(malta_corona1, aes(x=date, y=cases, color=type)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Malta: Daily Covid-19 cases by type") + facet_grid(rows = vars(type))
```
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Above 2 graphs shows the number of confirmed, death and recovered covid-19 cases in Malta in daily basis in the same graph. According to the both graphs it shows that the daily covid-19 death cases are very law compared to both covid-19 confirmed & recovered cases. We can clearly see that confirmed cases have been started before recovered covid-19 cases.  Also we can clearly identify that the curves of confirmed and recovered cases have some similarities to each other.  From January 2021 to middle of March 2021, we can see a rapid increase in both confirmed and recovered cases. After that there has been a significant decrease in both cases until August 2021.
</p>

#### **Total Covid-19 Death cases in Malta**
```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
death_corona1 <-  death_corona%>% mutate(cum_cases = cumsum(cases))
ggplot(death_corona1, aes(date, cum_cases)) + geom_path(size = 1) +
  ggtitle("Malta: Total Covid-19 death cases")
sum(death_corona$cases)
```

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
We can see there were no coronavirus death cases in Malta before the month of April 2020. Covid-19 total death cases from April to August 2020, have been increase to 50. But then from August 2020 to April 2021 there has been a rapid increase of death cases and total number of death cases have been raised to 400.
</p>

  ggtitle("Malta: Total Covid-19 confirmed cases")
sum(confirm_corona$cases)
```

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
According to figure there were no coronavirus confirmed pations in Malta before begining of the month of April 2020. From beginning of April 2020 to December 2020, the total number of confirmed cases have been increses to 10000. But after that there has been a rapid increase in the number of total confirmed covid-19 cases. Total number of covid-19 recovered cases has passed 30000 in end of April 2021. Tthe highest number of total confirmed cases has reached to 36994.
</p>

#### **Total Covid-19 recovered cases**

# **3.  Conclusions and Discussion**

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The COVID-19 pandemic in Malta is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of the disease in Malta was an Italian 12-year-old girl on 7 March 2020. The girl and her family were in isolation, as required by those following the Maltese health authority's guidelines who were in Italy or other highly infected countries.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The data set has been cosidered from 22 of Junuary 2020 to 18 of September 2021 time period. Here we have been given daily coronavirus confirmed cases, recovered cases in Malta  for this analysis.There were negative values and null values in coronavirus cases on data set . They were the outliers in this data set. Therefore I changed negative values and null values to zero.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Here I have done an Exploratory Data Analysis to discuss the daily Covid-19 confirmed, recovered and death cases seperately. Then I discussed the confirmed, death and recovered Covid-19 cases in Malta in daily basis in the same graph. After that I considered the Total Covid-19 confirmed, recovered and death cases seperately.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Malta is situated close to France, Italy, Albania, Greece, Algeria, Tunesia and Libya. These countries can be also considered as one of its neighboring countries. Here France, Italy, Albania & Greece are Europe countries and Algeria, Tunisia & Libya are North African countries. I made an comparison to Covid-19 cases of Malta with its Europe and North African neighbouring countries.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In Malta, we can see the daily covid-19 death cases are very law compared to both covid-19 confirmed & recovered cases. Also we can clearly see that confirmed cases have been started before recovered covid-19 cases. From January 2021 to middle of March 2021, we can see a rapid increase in both confirmed and recovered cases. After that there has been a significant decrease in both cases until August 2021. For the period  when we consider the total Covid-19 cases, we can see total number of death cases have been raised to 400,  total confirmed cases has reached to 36994 and total recovered cases has reached to 32483.
When we compared Malta with its Europe and North African neighbour countries, we can clearly see that Malta covid-19 confirmed, recovered and death cases are the lowest than other countries.
