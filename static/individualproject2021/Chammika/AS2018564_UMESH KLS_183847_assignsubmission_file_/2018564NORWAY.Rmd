# **1.Introduction**

Norway is a country in Northern Europe occupying the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula as well as the volcanic island Jan Mayen and the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard. Norway borders the North Sea, the North Atlantic Ocean, Finland, Sweden, and Russia. The geography of Norway is rugged with steep fjords and mountains. The government system is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy; the chief of state is the king, and the head of government is the prime minister. Norway has a mixed economic system with a combination of free-market activity and government intervention. Norway is a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Norway has a total area of 385,207 square kilometres (148,729 sq mi) and had a population of 5,385,300 in November 2020. The country shares a long eastern border with Sweden (1,619 km or 1,006 mi long). Norway is bordered by Finland and Russia to the north-east and the Skagerrak strait to the south, with Denmark on the other side. Norway has an extensive coastline, facing the North Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea. The maritime influence dominates Norway's climate with mild lowland temperatures on the sea coasts, whereas the interior, while colder, is also a lot milder than areas elsewhere in the world on such northerly latitudes. Even during polar night in the north, temperatures above freezing are commonplace on the coastline. The maritime influence brings high rainfall and snowfall to some areas of the country.

### • Climate condition

Norway is a popular tourist destination year-round, thanks to its gorgeous green fjords in the summer and the northern lights in the winter. The weather in Norway is warmer than might be expected considering how far north it is. This is due to the warmth of the Gulf Stream, which results in a temperate climate for much of the country. This Scandinavian country has a climate that easily fluctuates from year to year, especially in its most northern parts, which are located at the edge of the global temperate zone. In the northern areas, summer temperatures can reach above 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius), while winters are dark and have more snow than other parts of the country. In the coastal and inland regions, the climate varies considerably. The coastal areas have a climate with cooler summers. Winters are relatively moderate and rainy with little snow or frost. Inland areas (like Oslo) have a continental climate with colder winters (think minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit, or 25 below zero Celsius) but warmer summers. Weather in Norway is best between May and September when it's usually mild and clear.

### • Lock-down Status of the country

20/08/2021: The Norwegian Government has decided to introduce entry restrictions and quarantine requirements for several areas in the Nordic region, two countries in Europe, and some third countries. This decision is based on an updated assessment of the infection rate by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and is intended to reduce the risk of imported cases of COVID-19. All of the changes will enter into effect on Monday 23 August at 12 am.

## **2.Exploratory Data Analysis**

### • Visualization of death, confirmed, recovered, active cases

### Summary of data

```{r, include=FALSE}
Norway_corona[Norway_corona < 0]
Norway_corona$cases <- abs(Norway_corona$cases)
Norway_corona
view(Norway_corona)
filter(Norway_corona, cases >=0)
view(filter(Norway_corona, cases >=0))

new_Norway_corona <- filter(Norway_corona, cases >=0)
new_Norway_corona
view(new_Norway_corona)

```

```{r,comment=NA}

summary(new_Norway_corona)

```


```{r, comment=NA, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
death_Norway_corona <-  filter(new_Norway_corona, type == "death")

ggplot(death_Norway_corona,aes(x=date, y=cases)) + geom_line(color="green")+ ggtitle("Daily covid 19 deaths")
```

In this plot illustrates the  number of deaths in Norway from 22/01/2020 to 18/09/2021. It can be seen that the number of deaths increase slightly from March to May 2020. Then the number of deaths fell slightly in the end of 2020.But the number of deaths start increased again in January of 2021 and it continue until June 2021 like wave.Again, the number of deaths fell slightly in July 2021.But it increased after the end of July 2021.


```{r, comment=NA, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
death_Norway_corona <-  filter(new_Norway_corona, type == "confirmed")

ggplot(death_Norway_corona,aes(x=date, y=cases)) +  geom_line(color="red")+ ggtitle("Daily covid 19 confirmed")
```

In this plot illustrates the  number of confirmed in Norway from 22/01/2020 to 18/09/2021. It can be seen that the number of confirmed increase sharply until November 2020. Then the number of confirmed fell slightly March and July months 2020.But the number of confirmed start sharply increased again start of September month in 2021. 

```{r, comment=NA, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
death_Norway_corona <-  filter(new_Norway_corona, type == "recovered")

ggplot(death_Norway_corona,aes(x=date, y=cases)) + geom_line(color="blue")+ ggtitle("Daily covid 19 recovered")
```

In this plot illustrates the  number of recovered in Norway from 22/01/2020 to 18/09/2021. It can be seen that the number of recovered increase sharply on 22/05/2020. Then the number of recovered fell slightly from May to end of 2020. Again, the number of recovered increase sharply on 16/11/2016.


```{r, include= FALSE }

new_Norway_corona1 <- new_Norway_corona %>% pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = cases)
new_Norway_corona1

Norway_corona1 <- new_Norway_corona1[!is.na(new_Norway_corona1$recovered),]
Norway_corona1

Norway_active_cases <- Norway_corona1 %>% mutate(active = cumsum(confirmed)-(cumsum(death)+cumsum(recovered)))
Norway_active_cases

```

```{r, comment=NA, mesage=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(Norway_active_cases, aes(x=date, y=active)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Daily Covid-19 active cases")

```

The chart above shows the number of patients receiving treatment in Norway as of the relevant date.  Shows a slight increase in the number of patients reported these days.

### • Comparison between the neighbouring countries

```{r, include=FALSE}

unique(coronavirus$country)
norway_corona <- filter(new_Norway_corona)

Germany_corona<-coronavirus%>%filter(country=="Germany")

Finland_corona<-coronavirus%>%filter(country=="Finland")

Denmark_corona<-coronavirus%>%filter(country=="Denmark")

countries_corona<-as.data.frame(rbind(Norway_corona,Germany_corona,Finland_corona,Denmark_corona))

countries_death<-countries_corona%>%filter(type=="death")

```

```{r, comment=NA, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(countries_death,
       aes(x=date,y=cases,fill=type,col=country))+
  geom_line()+geom_point()+ 
  facet_wrap(~country,ncol = 4)+coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("Comparison  of covid-19 deaths between the other countries")

```

According to the plot , we can't see a dangerous situation in norway than it's neibhouring countries..
Specially when we consider these informations between Germany and Norway,  there is a huge difference between those two countries...When we consider about population, Norwegian population is equal to other neibhouring countries like Denmark and Finland..So Covid 19 cases and number of deaths in Norway is way similar to those two neighbouring countries..There is no huge gap between these three countries although in January 2021 there is a huge improvement of covid 19 cases in Germany , we can't see any considerable information about Norway.


```{r, include=FALSE}

unique(coronavirus$country)
norway_corona <- filter(new_Norway_corona)

Germany_corona<-coronavirus%>%filter(country=="Germany")

Finland_corona<-coronavirus%>%filter(country=="Finland")

Denmark_corona<-coronavirus%>%filter(country=="Denmark")

countries_corona<-as.data.frame(rbind(Norway_corona,Germany_corona,Finland_corona,Denmark_corona))

countries_recovered<-countries_corona%>%filter(type=="recovered")

```

```{r, comment=NA, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(countries_recovered,
       aes(x=date,y=cases,fill=type,col=country))+
  geom_line()+geom_point()+ 
  facet_wrap(~country,ncol = 4)+coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("Comparison  of covid-19 recovered between the other countries")

```

At first glance , acoording to the informations , can't see a big achievement in Norway.Except Germany,  other three countris have same population in those countris but in Norway there isn't success in recovering task than Denmark and Finland.Specially in the end of 2020 and the begging of 2021 , we can see some improvement in recovery information but in Norway , it is a regular situation.


```{r, include=FALSE}

unique(coronavirus$country)
norway_corona <- filter(new_Norway_corona)

German_corona<-coronavirus%>%filter(country=="Germany")

Finland_corona<-coronavirus%>%filter(country=="Finland")

Denmark_corona<-coronavirus%>%filter(country=="Denmark")

countries_corona<-as.data.frame(rbind(Norway_corona,German_corona,Finland_corona,Denmark_corona))

countries_confirmed<-countries_corona%>%filter(type=="confirmed")

```


```{r, comment=NA, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(countries_confirmed,
       aes(x=date,y=cases,fill=type,col=country))+
  geom_line()+geom_point()+ 
  facet_wrap(~country,ncol = 4)+coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("Comparison  of covid-19 confirmed between the other countries")

```

According to this informations about confermed cases of covid 19 , we can this is very similar wave pattern in Norway section. We can't see any big difference between covid 19 cases and deaths informations,  recovered data and this confirmed data. There is a same wave between those charts.Like other comparisons informations about Norway, is little bit similar to Denmark and Finland also far different than Germany.There is a regular flow of numbers in this chart also like other informations.

##  **3.Conclusions and Discussion**

Norway confirmed first case of coronavirus(COVID-19) on 26 February and the firth death by covid-19 on 14 March 2020.
On 12 March the Norwegian Government presented new policies intended to limit and delay the COVID-19 outbreak. Regulations ranged from advice on avoiding infection through restrictions to travel and group meetings and enforced closure of restaurants, coffee shops and pubs if social distancing between customers was not maintained. Violations were punishable by fines or imprisonment for up to six months, but there have been very few cases of the authorities issuing fines.
Corona conditions in Norway are currently declining.  Proper habits should continue to be followed.Also, the prevalence of covidi19 in Norway is low compared to neighboring countries.
