# 1 Introduction

Jamaica is an island country located in the Caribbean Sea, south of Cuba and west of Haiti and the Dominican Republic & largest English speaking island in the Caribbean. It is 150 miles long and approximately 50 miles at the widest point, covering an area of 4,411 square miles. The interior is mountainous and gives rise to many rivers. The Blue Mountain, running east to west, reach a peak of 7,402 ft.The chief of state is the Queen of the United Kingdom, and the head of government is the Prime Minister of Jamaica. Jamaica has a mixed economic system which includes a variety of private freedom, combined with centralized economic planning and government regulation. Jamaica is a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).

## 1.1 Visualization of the Location

It is situated some 100 miles (160 km) west of Haiti, 90 miles (150 km) south of Cuba, and 390 miles (630 km) northeast of the nearest point on the mainland, Cape Gracias a Dios, on the Caribbean coast of Central America. The national capital is Kingston.

## 1.2 Climate Condition

In Jamaica, the climate is tropical, hot all year round, with little difference between winter and summer (just a few degrees). Even in winter, daytime temperatures are around 27/30 °C (81/86 °F) and night-time temperatures around 20/23 °C (68/73 °F). The southern coast, where Kingston is located, is slightly warmer in the winter months, in fact the maximum temperature is around 30 °C (86 °F) even in January.

![Average Temperatures of Kingston](https://i.ibb.co/hH6w9GQ/Screenshot-2021-09-27-at-19-38-59-Jamaica-climate-average-weather-temperature-precipitation-when-to.png)

The main difference between the seasons is found in rainfall and air humidity: the rainy season, from late April to October, is hot and muggy. Rainfall occurs mainly in the form of thunderstorm in late afternoon. In almost all of Jamaica, except on the west coast (see Negril), in July there is a relative lull in precipitation, and in any case, there are two peaks in May and October, that is, at the beginning and the end of the period.

![Average Precipitation in Kingston](https://i.ibb.co/txB05Dk/Screenshot-2021-09-27-at-19-39-49-Jamaica-climate-average-weather-temperature-precipitation-when-to.png)

The rain pattern is also due to the north-east trade winds, which are typical of the Tropics, and blow from November to March. Along the northern coast of Jamaica, rainfall ranges between 1,200 and 1,800 millimeters (47 and 70 inches) per year. The southern coasts and plains are not as rainy as the northern slopes because they are sheltered from the trade winds, either by the Blue Mountains or by the hills of the west-central part of the country. These elevations receive a lot of rainfall and are covered with forests (especially the Blue Mountains in the east and the southern part of the Trelawny Parish in the west). Therefore, the capital, Kingston, is not very rainy, in fact it receives about 800 mm (31.5 in) of rain per year; the Pedro Plains in the west receive little rainfall as well, around 800 millimeters (31.5 inches) per year.

## 1.3 Lock-down Status of the Country

Officials have announced increased domestic COVID-19-related restrictions in response to the rising number of cases. Stay-at-home orders will be enforced over seven days through Sept. 5. The impacted days are Aug. 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, and 31, and Sept. 5. On lockdown days, essential workers may still travel. There will also be exceptions for international travelers, persons seeking medical assistance, and those attending religious services on Aug. 29 and Sept. 5.

# 3 Conclusions and Discussion

* At the current moment Jamaica is in the middle of third wave of COVID-19.
* The recovered cases are bit low compared to confirmed cases & Death cases distribution is very low compared to the confirmed cases distribution.
* Here we compare other four neighbour countries (Cuba, Dominica, Bahamas, Haiti) with Jamaica.
* As you can see in the above figures compared to Jamaica, Dominica Republic doing very well in managing COVID-19 pandemic situation.
* Dominica has very low confirmed and death cases compared to Jamaica and as well as other three countries.
* Overall compared to other caribbean countries in above figures Jamaica's government doing really good job to controll COVID-19 pandemic situation.
* Actually COVID-19 infections are decreasing in Jamaica, with 374 new infections reported on average each day. That’s 52% of the peak — the highest daily average reported on September 7.
* Jamaica has administered at least 743,184 doses of COVID vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that’s enough to have vaccinated about 12.6% of the country’s population.
* During the last week reported, Jamaica averaged about 3,292 doses administered each day. At that rate, it will take a further 180 days to administer enough doses for another 10% of the population.
