## **Covid - 19**

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The new virus was subsequently named the “COVID-19 virus”. 
On 31 December 2019, WHO was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan City, China. A novel corona virus was identified as the cause by Chinese authorities on 7 January 2020 and was temporarily named “2019-nCoV”.
On 11 March 2020, the rapid increase in the number of cases outside China led the WHO Director-General to announce that the outbreak could be characterized as a pandemic. By then more than 118 000 cases had been reported in 114 countries, and 4291 deaths had been recorded.
In order to that the virus has being spreading over the whole world until now(2021 september),We cannot strictly predict when covid-19 will end.

### **1. Visualization of the location**         

 Algeria, is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa. It is the largest country by total area in Africa, and by extension, the Arab world, and is bordered to the northeast by Tunisia; to the east by Libya; to the southeast by Niger; to the southwest by Mali, Mauritania, and Western Sahara; to the west by Morocco; and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea. The country has a semi-arid geography, with most of the population living in the fertile north and the Sahara dominating the geography of the south. Algeria covers an area of 2,381,741 square kilometres (919,595 sq mi), making it the world's tenth largest nation by area. With a population of 44 million, and is the ninth-most populous country in Africa. The capital and largest city is Algiers, located in the far north on the Mediterranean coast.

Pre-1962 Algeria has seen many empires and dynasties, including ancient Numidians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Umayyads, Abbasids, Rustamid, Idrisid, Aghlabids, Fatimids, Zirid, Hammadids, Almoravids, Almohads, Zayyanids, Spaniards, Ottomans and finally, the French Colonial Empire. The vast majority of Algeria's population is Arab-Berber, practicing Islam, and using the official languages of Arabic and Berber. However, French serves as an administrative and education language in some contexts, and Algerian Arabic is the main spoken language.

Algeria is a semi-presidential republic, with local constituencies consisting of 58 provinces and 1,541 communes. Algeria is a regional power in North Africa, and a middle power in global affairs. It has the highest Human Development Index of all non-island African countries and one of the largest economies on the continent, based largely on energy exports. Algeria has the world's sixteenth-largest oil reserves and the ninth-largest reserves of natural gas. Sonatrach, the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa, supplying large amounts of natural gas to Europe. Algeria's military is one of the largest in Africa, and has the largest defence budget on the continent. It is a member of the African Union, the Arab League, OPEC, the United Nations, and the Arab Maghreb Union, of which it is a founding member.

### **2. Climate and weather condition**
Algeria is one of the largest countries on the African continent and has to deal with fairly large differences in climate. Algeria is is known for its Sahara desert, oases and the Atlas Mountains. The country consists for around 85% of desert. It has a long coastline and the coastal areas have a mild Mediterranean climate with hot summers and cool and rainy winters. In the highlands summers are hot and dry. Winter rains (less heavy then the coast) in the highlands begin in October. In the months January, February and March there are many sandstorms. 
Northern Algeria lies within the temperate zone, and its climate is similar to that of other Mediterranean countries, although the diversity of the relief provides sharp contrasts in temperature. The coastal region has a pleasant climate, with winter temperatures averaging from 10° to 12° C (50° to 54° F ) and average summer temperatures ranging from 24° to 26° C (75° to 79° F ). Rainfall in this region is abundant—38 to 69 cm (15 to 27 in) per year, and up to 100 cm (40 in) in the eastern part—except in the area around Oran (Ouahran), where mountains form a barrier against rain-carrying winds. When heavy rains fall (often more than 3.8 cm/1.5 in within 24 hours), they flood large areas and then evaporate so quickly that they are of little help in cultivation.

Farther inland, the climate changes; winters average 4° to 6° C (39° to 43° F ), with considerable frost and occasional snow on the massifs; summers average 26° to 28° C (79° to 82° F ). In this region, prevailing winds are westerly and northerly in winter and easterly and northeasterly in summer, resulting in a general increase in precipitation from September to December and a decrease from January to August; there is little or no rainfall in the summer months.

In the Sahara Desert, temperatures range from –10° to 34° C (14° to 93° F ), with extreme highs of 49° C (120° F ). There are daily variations of more than 44° C (80° F ). Winds are frequent and violent. Rainfall is irregular and unevenly distributed.

The rains are quite abundant. They vary according to the areas between 1.000 mm in the eastern areas (Grande Kabylia, Piccola Kabylia and Djebel Edough) and 400 mm in the western areas (Piana di Chelif, Aurès and Amour mountains).
In the spring months, particularly in April, a warm wind sometimes blows from the desert, the sirocco that transports large quantities of sand from the desert, causing intense sand storms and a sharp rise in temperature.
Algers is the capital and the largest city in algeria.Let's check there whether,Because the algeria whether is not same fr everywhere in algeria,hence it's too big country.

figure 1 shows that all the type of corona cases positively distributed.As well as we can see deaths has normally or binomial modal distribution. To visualize this distribution we can plot density plot. This figure also show that all the types are positively distributed and there is a normally or binomial model distribution for deaths.

## **2.COMPARISON WITH OTHER COUNTRIES**

I found Brazil,Italy and Libya  for compare with Algeria.These countries are close to the Algeria.Therefore we can conclude that the sunlight,wind,whether and etc.. are approximately same in those countries.

##### Brazil description

Brazil officially the Federative Republic of Brazil is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. At 8.5 million square kilometres (3,300,000 sq mi) and with over 211 million people, Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country by area and the sixth most populous. Its capital is Brasília, and its most populous city is São Paulo. The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states and the Federal District. It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world;[15] as well as the most populous Roman Catholic-majority country.

Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers (4,655 mi). It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest, as environmental degradation through processes like deforestation has direct impacts on global issues like climate change and biodiversity loss.


##### Italy description

Italy (Italian: Italia officially the Italian Republic  is a country consisting of a peninsula delimited by the Alps and several islands surrounding it. Italy is located in the center of the Mediterranean Sea, in Southern Europe and is also often considered part of Western Europa.A unitary parliamentary republic with Rome as its capital and largest city, the country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 (116,350 sq mi) and shares land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino. Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland (Campione) and a maritime exclave in Tunisian waters (Lampedusa). With around 60 million inhabitants, Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union, after Germany and France.   

##### Libya description  
 
Libya  is a country in the Maghreb region in North Africa bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the east, Sudan to the southeast, Chad to the south, Niger to the southwest, Algeria to the west and Tunisia to the northwest. The sovereign state is made of three historical regions: Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica. With an area of almost 700,000 square miles (1.8 million km2), Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa and is the 16th largest country in the world. Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world. The largest city and capital, Tripoli, is located in western Libya and contains over three million of Libya's seven million people.

Libya has been inhabited by Berbers since the late Bronze Age as descendants from Iberomaurusian and Capsian cultures.The Phoenicians established trading posts in western Libya and ancient Greek colonists established city-states in eastern Libya. Parts of Libya were variously ruled by Carthaginians, Persians, Egyptians and Greeks before the entire region becoming a part of the Roman Empire. Libya was an early center of Christianity. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the area of Libya was mostly occupied by the Vandals until the 7th century when invasions brought Islam to the region

In plot 5,we pay atension on the conformed cases of those choosen countries.The Algeria and Libya shows the same appearance ,Then we can conclude same covid cases are  reporting  situation in there. Italy is bit high than the Algeria and Libya.But the Brazil is  more high appearance showing in the plot.Then the confirmed cases are reporting more in brazil than Algeria and other my comparing countries.The good conclusion is the Algeria confirmed cases are the lower.

# **CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION**   

we focuced here about,Algeria covid-19 situation.The data set is between 2020-01-22 to 2021-09-18.Hence we give conclusions ,according to that time period.At fist before do analysis,I had to change minus values,because these are missing data.(If that data are in my data set ,the given conclusions be violated.)I found Brazil,Italy and Libya for compare with Algeria.These countries are close to the Algeria.Therefore we can conclude that the sunlight,wind,whether and etc.. are approximately same in those countries.

##### Conclusions

+ The first covid case was diagnosed in Algeria in 2020-02-25..
+ The maximum confirm cases was reported in 2021-07-28 and it was 1927.Untill now, The      covid cases are confirmation is going low.It is a good sign of decreasing covid           situation  in Algeria. 
+ Death cases are also decreasing according to the time.And also the very low death cases   are reporting Algeria.The maximum death case was 49 and it was on 2021-07-28.
+ The "Time series plot' shows some cyclic component and trend component.Then we can        conclude there were several covid-19 waves in Algeria.We can conclude that was build by   the lockdown ,curfew ,other social limitations and also the vaccinations. 
+ The confirmed and death cases are going decrease.The reason may be the improvement of     vaccination programme in algeria.Untill now there are 9.7% had taken the vaccine in       Algeria.
+ Comparing to Brazil,Italy,algeria confirmed ,recovery and death cases are very            low.But the Libya is approximately shows the same representations.The cause will be the   Libya and Algeria in the Africa continent.And the Italy is in Europe and Brazil is in     South america continent.Brazil is more far than italy.Then brazil cannot spread more to   the Algeria. We can conclude ,by the location approximately we can tell about how much    it  shold spread covid -19.
+ finally can say the covid-19 situation will  decrease quickly if the limitations are existence.But strickly we cannot predict what will happen because new covid-19 varities are arising over the world wide.
