# 1.Background

## 1.1 Introduction

A cluster of cases of unknown cause pneumonia was reported to the World Health Organization on 31 December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province in China. A previously unknown new virus was identified in January 2020, later named the 2019 novel coronavirus, and samples from cases and genetic analysis of the virus indicated this was the cause of the outbreak. This novel corona virus was named by WHO in February 2020 as corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus is known as SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease is COVID-19.  

## 1.2 Location of Kazakhstan

Kazakhstan returned to a country-wide lockdown on July 5 as COVID-19 cases sprung up. The first lockdown of the country lasted from March 16th through May 11th. The second lockdown, which is scheduled to last at least two weeks, seems to be the world's first such reimposition of a nationwide lockdown.The two-week lockdown that could be extended if the virus continues to spread is restricting public gatherings and banning family and holiday gatherings. Citizens over 65 are expected to stay at home but others are allowed to practice alone outdoors.

The number of cases of coronavirus in Kazakhstan has been increasing tenfold since the lifting of the first lockdown measures began. Kazakhstan had registered 5,207 cases of coronavirus and 32 deaths by May 11, the last day of state of emergency and lockdown. As of 13 July in the country there were 59,899 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 375 deaths. But the situation is rapidly evolving and could be a lot worse than this.

## 1.3 Climate Change in Kazakhstan

 Kazakhstan, a vast country of Central Asia, has a markedly continental climate, with very cold winters almost everywhere, while summers are warm in the north and definitely hot in the south. There are no obstacles that could protect the country from cold air masses of polar or Siberian origin, while in summer, hot winds from the Iranian deserts can blow. In addition, because of the huge distance from the oceans, the Asian continent cools down a lot in winter and heats up in summer, so, both the highest and the lowest records are noticeable. In fact, in the north, the temperature can reach -40 °C (-40 °F) in winter and 40 °C (104 °F) in summer, while in the south, it can go from -35 °C (-31 °F) in winter to 45 °C (113 °F) in summer. The clash between different air masses can give rise to strong winds and dust storms, especially in spring and in the south, while in winter, the northern wind can cause snow storms, but without great accumulation on account of the scarcity of precipitation.
 
## 1.4 Demographics of Kazakhstan
 
 The current population of Kazakhstan is 19,408,414 based on projections of the latest United Nations data. The UN estimates the July 1, 2022 population at 19,397,998.
 
 The ethnic majority of the country is the ethnic Kazakhs (63.1%), although there are a large number of other ethnicities present as well, such as ethnic Russians (23.7%), Uzbeks (2.9%), Ukrainians (2.1%), Uygurs (1.4%), Tatars (1.3%) and Germans (1.1%).

Some minority groups in Kazakhstan, including Germans, Ukrainians, Chechens, Koreans, and Meskhetian Turks were deported to Kazakhstan in the 1930s and 1940s by Stalin as Russian political opponents.

At the end of the 1980s, ethnic Russians were at almost 38% of the population while Kazakhstanis were in a majority in just 7 of the country's 20 regions. There were also 1 million Germans in Kazakhstan prior to 1991. After the Soviet Union dissolved, most emigrated to Germany. Emigration of Russians and Germans returned indigenous Kazakhs to a majority in the country.

## 1.5. Lockdown status of the country
  
  Kazakhstan returned to a country-wide lockdown on July 5 as COVID-19 cases sprung up. The first lockdown of the country lasted from March 16th through May 11th. The second lockdown, which is scheduled to last at least two weeks, seems to be the world's first such reimposition of a nationwide lockdown.The two-week lockdown that could be extended if the virus continues to spread is restricting public gatherings and banning family and holiday gatherings. Citizens over 65 are expected to stay at home but others are allowed to practice alone outdoors.

The number of cases of coronavirus in Kazakhstan has been increasing tenfold since the lifting of the first lockdown measures began. Kazakhstan had registered 5,207 cases of coronavirus and 32 deaths by May 11, the last day of state of emergency and lockdown. As of 13 July in the country there were 59,899 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 375 deaths. But the situation is rapidly evolving and could be a lot worse than this.
 
## 1.6. Actions taken by the government
 
 Since the beginning of the pandemic, Kazakh authorities have taken a number of socio-economic measures. The country has had a state of emergency for about two months. Operations in Quarantine are ongoing. Despite the quarantine measures, however, the spread of the virus has recently been accelerating. The number of infected people already is around 20,000. Over a hundred people died of the disease. For people that's very worrying.          
The epidemic did not go through government representatives at different levels.
On 15 March Kazakhstan declared a state of emergency. Exports of some key food products were banned, while food and freight imports were maintained, and a food price cap was introduced. The Ministry of Agriculture lifted an existing ban on meat exports on 30 March, but introduced quotas for wheat and flour exports during quarantine periods. The government has closed all frontiers for non-citizens to enter, and has put air and rail traffic on hold. According to the national railway company, however, freight traffic with China and Russia has not been affected, suggesting some private enterprises continue to operate.

 All records are available for the time period from 01st January 2020 to 23rd June 2022.

 
## 2.2 COVID-19 Statistics of Kazakhstan

Following table shows that COVID 19 year wise average cases of confirmed,death and recovery cases of Kazakhastan.It shows that the higher confirmed average reported in 2021 year.Not only that the higher death cases and recovery cases reported in 2021.In 2022, recovery cases is 0 and average death cases also decreased than other two years.



```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,comment=NA,echo=FALSE}
tab <- matrix(c(583.2,7.968,518.01,2556.9,43.25,1042.6,1854.96,4.638,0), ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
colnames(tab) <- c('confirmed','death','recovery')
rownames(tab) <- c('2020','2021','2022')
tab <- as.table(tab)

```

According to the following bar plot we can say that COVID 19 cases are higher in 2021 in the Kazakhstan.


```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

summary(recovery_kaza_corona)

```
According to the graph of Daily Covid 19 death, we can say that the death case rate is gradually increased after some day point of 2021.It was momentarily after some day point of 2021 year.Not only that according to the graph of Daily Covid 19 recovered, there is no reported cases reported after some day point in 2021.

```


## 2.3 Kazakhstan VS Russia and China

 Kazakhstan is a country of Central Asia. It is bounded on the northwest and north by Russia, on the east by China. Kazakhstan is the largest country in Central Asia and the ninth largest in the world.



```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

near_countries <- filter(coronavirus,country =="Russia"|country=="Kazakhstan"|country=="China")
NeKz<-select(near_countries,date,cases,country,type)
Nek<-near_countries %>% mutate(cases = replace(cases, which(cases < 0), NA))

confirmed_near_countries <- filter(Nek, type == "confirmed")
death_near_countries <- filter(Nek, type == "death")
recovered_near_countries <- filter(Nek, type == "recovered")

ggplot(confirmed_near_countries, aes(x = date, y = cases, colour = country)) + geom_line() + 
  labs(title="Daily Confirmed cases Kazakhstan VS Russia and China")
 
```


It can be seen that COVID-19 cases were confirmed in China, Russia and Kazakhstan nearly in month of March in 2020.. The daily confirmed cases of all 3 countries reached its peak in before 2021 and again the countries reached its peak nearly 2022.In Russia,daily confirmed cases reported largely in 2022 than other two countries.


``` {r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}


ggplot(death_near_countries, aes(x = date, y = cases, colour = country)) + geom_jitter(size=0.8) + 
  labs(title="Daily death cases Kazakhstan VS Russia and China")

 



```

 


# 3.Discussion 

The progress of COVID-19 of Kazakhstan cannot be clearly understood by solely analyzing Kazakhstan’s data, therefore a comparison of Kazakhstan with countries of significance during the COVID-19 pandemic has been carried out in order to reach the final conclusions.

Through the data analysis process it was recognized that there were negative values for confirmed cases of some countries, the main causes may be the fact that at preliminary stages of testing some patients may have been diagnosed as COVID-19 positive and later on diagnosed as negative. Therefore, the data was pre-processed before the actual analysis by coding the negative values as missing values. This is the reason as to why there are discontinuities in some line plots.


# 4.Conclusion

The COVID 19 has been very well controlled inside the country.As we can see through the above graphs the death rate is very lower when compared to the confirmed COVID 19 cases.Furthermore, as we can see from the graphs, the reporting confirmed corona cases rate has started to gradually increased in 2020 to 2022. 

According to the graph of Daily covid 19 death, we can say that the death case rate is gradually increased after some day point of 2021.It was momentarily after some day point of 2021 year.Not only that according to the graph of Daily covid 19 recovered, there is no reported cases reported after some day point in 2021.

 The comparing of daily covid 19 cases of Kazakhstan with China And Russia it shows that COVID-19 cases were confirmed in China, Russia and Kazakhstan nearly in month of March in 2020.In Russia,daily confirmed cases reported largely in 2022 than other two countries.

COVID 19 cases are higher in 2021 in the Kazakhstan.In addition to that The covid-19 has been very well controlled inside the country.As we can see through the above graphs the death rate is very lower when compared to the confirmed covid-19 case.
