# Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health crisis that has affected countries across all continents in the world except Antarctica. Therefore, understanding the strategic responses related towards controlling the pandemic can be of much importance. This report is an exploratory analysis of the pandemic in North Macedonia by studying data from 22nd January 2020 to 23rd June 2022 and comparing it with neighboring countries as well as countries identified as of key importance with respect to COVID-19. The main reason for this is the effective strategies implemented by the government along with complete lockdown. The effectiveness of this strategy and the impact to prevailing COVID-19 figures is yet to be determined.


The COVID-19 pandemic in North Macedonia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Keywords: North Macedonia, COVID-19

Corona Virus Disease, more commonly known as COVID – 19 is a virus originating from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) family of viruses. The symptoms of the disease being more or less similar to those of influenza (flu) or common cold makes it even more difficult to accurately diagnose it without further testing. The disease easily transmitted through direct contact with an infected person or through contaminated surfaces can be fatal in rare cases, yet no vaccine has been developed up to date.

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

## 2.1 Structure of Data


The data set used for this analysis is *The 2019 Novel corona virus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV)* data set which is easily available as an installable package in RStudio. The source of this data is Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) corona virus.
The data set contains the daily summary of corona virus cases worldwide. All cases are recorded according to the following variables;

  + Date
  + Country
  + Province/state; if available
  + Latitude of center of geographic region defined by country/province
  + Longitude of center of geographic region defined by country/province
  + Type of reported case – confirmed, death, recovered
  + Number of cases on given date
  + Country code
  + Country or province population
All records are available for the time period from 01st January 2020 to 23rd June 2022.
The analysis has been done by R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics.

According to the following bar plot we can say that COVID 19 cases are higher in 2021 in the Republic of North Macedonia.

NewNM<-data.frame(NewestNMa)
df<-NewNM%>% separate(date,c("Year","Month","day"),sep="-")

ggplot(df1,aes(x=Year))+geom_bar(data=df2,aes(color="2020"))+geom_bar(data=df3,aes(color="2021"))+ geom_bar(data=df4,aes(color="2022"))
```


```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE,comment=NA,include=FALSE}

 which(is.na(NewestNMa$cases))
 NewestNMa$cases[2330] = mean(c(NewestNMa$cases[2329], NewestNMa$cases[2331]))
length(NewestNMa$cases)
NewestNMa$col <- as.factor(c(rep("black", 2328),rep("red", 2), rep("black", 2652-2330)))
```

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE,comment=NA}

summary(recovery_NMacedonia_corona)




```
According to the Daily covid 19 recovered graph,we can say that there are no recovery cases after some day point in 2021.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}

NewNM<-data.frame(NewestNMa )
df<-NewNM%>% separate(date,c("Year","Month","day"),sep="-")

## 2.3 North Macedonia vs Kosovo and Albania

North Macedonia is situated very close to the Kosovo and Albania, Greece can also be considered as one of its neighboring countries, therefore this section elaborates the COVID-19 situation of North Macedonia when compared to its neighboring countries; Albania and Kosovo.

![Neighbouring country for North Macedonia,Source: stiri.tvr.ro](E:/3rd Yr/Stat/R programming/Individual Project/pp.jpg)

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

near_countries <- filter(coronavirus,country =="Albania"|country=="Kosovo"|country=="North Macedonia")
NC<-select(near_countries,date,cases,country,type)
NCT<-near_countries %>% mutate(cases = replace(cases, which(cases < 0), NA))



confirmed_near_countries <- filter(NCT, type == "confirmed")
death_near_countries <- filter(NCT, type == "death")
recovered_near_countries <- filter(NCT, type == "recovered")

ggplot(confirmed_near_countries, aes(x = date, y = cases, colour = country)) + geom_line() + 
  labs(title="Daily Confirmed cases North Macedonia VS Albania and Kosovo")


 
```

It can be seen that COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Kosovo and Albania after it was confirmed in North Macedonia.It confirmed after going some months in 2020 year. The daily confirmed cases of all 3 countries reached its peak in after 2021 and again the countries reached its peak nearly 2022; North Macedonia displaying a much drastic increase than the other countries. Daily confirmed cases of both Kosovo and Albania continuously keeps fluctuating.

``` {r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(death_near_countries, aes(x = date, y = cases, colour = country)) + geom_jitter(size=0.8) + 
  labs(title="Daily death cases North Macedonia VS Albania and Kosovo")




```

When comparing the number of deaths; it can be seen that in the case of both Kosovo and Albania, deaths were reported after deaths were reported in North Macedonia. North Macedonia reached highest death cases in 2021 year. 


# 3.Discussion 

The progress of COVID-19 of North Macedonia cannot be clearly understood by solely analyzing North Macedonia's data, therefore a comparison of Ireland with countries of significance during the COVID-19 pandemic has been carried out in order to reach the final conclusions.

Through the data analysis process it was recognized that there were negative values for confirmed cases of some countries, the main causes may be the fact that at preliminary stages of testing some patients may have been diagnosed as COVID-19 positive and later on diagnosed as negative. Therefore, the data was pre-processed before the actual analysis by coding the negative values as missing values. This is the reason as to why there are discontinuities in some line plots.


# 4.Conclusion

According to the summary measurement it table shows that year wise mean comparison of confirmed,death and recovery cases of North Macedonia.It shows that the average confirmed cases of 2022 year is greater than the average confirmed cases of 2020 year.Not only that mean recovery cases of 2022 year is 0.So we can say that COVID 19 confirmed cases was increased by year wise in North Macedonia.According to the summary table of cases by types and year, it can be seen that highest mean percentages of confirmed cases during the 2022 year.

When comparing the number of deaths; it can be seen that in the case of both Kosovo and Albania, deaths were reported after deaths were reported in North Macedonia. North Macedonia reached highest death cases in 2021 year.
