## **COVID-19 pandemic in Algeria**
>The COVID-19 pandemic in Algeria is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have spread to Algeria in February 2020. In December it was announced that Algeria intended to launch COVID-19 vaccinations in January 2021

#### **Background** 
>On 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019.
Unlike SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

### **Distribution of Covid-19 in Algeria** 

This figure shows that, confirmed, death and recovered cases in Algeria. At first, there were no cases but shortly, the number of confirmed cases increased speedily and it is much larger than death and confirmed cases. Especially, Algeria has a small number of death cases than confirmed cases. Overall Algeria has been performing well in keeping the fatality rate low and ensuring that nearly half the confirmed patients are recovered. 

#### **Summary about the Filtered Algeria Corona Dataset**
```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
summary(algeria_corona)

```



This is the summary about filtered data set Algeria from the coronavirus data set. 
So can see in cases column there minus values here. Cases cannot be minus. That is error. So, we do some statistical things to avoid this error. 
The data set has data from 2020-01-22 to 2022-06-23. According to the above summary we can see the mean number of cases are 102. The maximum number of cases are 2521.

   arrange(date) %>%
   mutate(active = confirmed - death - recovery) %>%
   mutate(total_active_cases = cumsum(active),
          total_recovered_cases = cumsum(recovery),
          total_death_cases = cumsum(death))

```
</center>

According to the Figure, we can say that Tunisia has the highest death corona cases. As well as Niger has the lowest death corona cases. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Conclusions and Discussion**

In my data set, I found four NA values. province variable is already NA. So, I had some limitations in the data set. In the recovery_algeria_corona case, after the 6th of August,2021 all the data goes to zero. I don,t know the reason. The comparison with Tunisia, Libya & Niger, in all three cases Tunisia has the highest amount and Niger has the lowest amount. I  think there has a population reason. Approximately Tunisia has an 11 million population and Niger has a 2 million population.
