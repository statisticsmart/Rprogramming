# Exploratory Data Analysis
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA}
library(coronavirus)
data("coronavirus")
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)


germany_corona <- coronavirus %>% filter(country == "Germany")

germany_corona <- as.data.frame(germany_corona)

head(germany_corona)
tail(germany_corona)

summary(germany_corona)
```

#### Summary of confirmed cases in Germany
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}

germany_corona <- coronavirus %>% filter(country == "Germany")
confirmed_germany_corona <- germany_corona %>% filter(type=="confirmed")
summary(confirmed_germany_corona)

ggplot(confirmed_germany_corona, aes(x=date, y=cases)) +
  geom_line()+ ggtitle("Germany:  Covid-19 Confirmed")

```

Initially the daily active cases count in Germany was relatively high.  from January 2022 to April 2022.

#### Summary of death cases in Germany
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
germany_corona <- coronavirus %>% filter(country == "Germany")
death_germany_corona <- germany_corona %>% filter(type=="death")
summary(death_germany_corona)

ggplot(death_germany_corona, aes(x=date, y=cases)) +
  geom_line()+ ggtitle("Germany:  Covid-19 deaths")
```

In the above figure shows the highest number of daily deaths have been recorded in the first few months of 2021.

#### Summary of recovered cases in Germany
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE,comment=NA}
germany_corona <- coronavirus %>% filter(country == "Germany")

recovered_germany_corona <- germany_corona %>% filter(type=="recovered")
summary(recovered_germany_corona)

ggplot(recovered_germany_corona, aes(x=date, y=cases)) +
  geom_line() + ggtitle("Germany: Covid-19 Recoveries")

```

## Comparison with other Countries

countries_cases<-countries_corona%>%filter(type=="confirmed")
ggplot(countries_cases,
       aes(x=date,y=cases,fill=type,col=country))+
  geom_line()+geom_point()+ 
  facet_wrap(~country,ncol = 4)+coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("Comparison of confirmed covid-19 patients between the neighbooring countries")
```

ggplot(countries_death,

# Conclusion and Discussion
* German is highly affected from coronavirus, according the above data exploration Switzerland is the least affected country form coronavirus.
* When Germany compared with Switzerland, Germany has relatively high death cases after September 2020. However from January 2021 onwards the death rate in Germany has fallen steadily.But deaths and confirmed cases in Germany has risen dramatically. Finally itâ€™s clear that daily cases are coming down.
* The data in this report will only provide a broader picture of how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected Germany until the 23rd of June 2022. To give a better overview and an understanding about the future of the pandemic in Germany more data regarding government support and other support given are required.
* This study is based on the data from 22 January 2020 to 23 June 2022.
