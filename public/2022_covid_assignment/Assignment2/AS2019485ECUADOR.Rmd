Above graph showas the confirmed no.of corona patients in Ecuador in daily basis. It shows that no.of confirmed Corona patients has been increasing since mid of 2020 upto mid of 2022 of February, and also  first three months of 2022  having more confirmations comparing to other months in the time period  with highest 17676 cases. This shows the lack of control of the situation in the end of the 2021 .

Covid 19 data is presented as a daily count of new confirmed infections for the preceding 24 hours.  It shows that no.of confirmed Corona patients has been increasing since mid of 2020 upto mid of 2022 of February, and also first three months of 2022 having more confirmations comparing to other months in the time period with highest 17676 cases. This shows the lack of control of the situation in the end of the 2021 .

-------------------------------------

```{r  echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
#cumaltiv e graph of active
act1 <- coronavirus %>% filter(country =="Ecuador")
        act2 <- act1 %>% filter(type == "confirmed")
      act3 <- act1 %>% filter(type == "death")
      act4 <- act1 %>% filter(type == "recovery")
    
      dfff <- data.frame(active1 =cumsum(act2$cases - (act3$cases + act4$cases)),date =act1$date)

l <- ggplot(dfff, aes(x=date, y=active1)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Date",
           y = "Active  cases",
           title = "Figure 4 :  Cumlative Distribution of Active Cases" )
ggplotly(l)
```

 By removing deaths and recoveries from total cases, we get “currently infected cases” or “active cases”.The number of active cases are on the rise in beginning of 2021, also it was showed a significant decrease from the end of 2021 onwards.
 
 
 
 
 
```{r}

```
 

--------------------------------------------
```{r warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,paged.print=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
clear_ecuador_corona<-ecuador_corona %>% mutate(cases = replace(cases, which(cases < 0), NA))

d<-ggplot(clear_ecuador_corona,aes(x=date,y=cases,color=type))+geom_path(size=1) + facet_grid(rows = vars(type)) +
  
  labs(x = "Time",
       y = "Cases",
       title = "Figure 5 : Distribution of Confiremed cases,Recoveries and Deaths ")
ggplotly(d)

```

According to figure 5 the number of recovery  cases are high compare to no of death and confirmed cases from the middle of 2020 to 2021 . 
It was identified that the number of confirmed cases showed a significant increase in 2022.The no death counts are with the average range  0-50 acroos the time period. The total summery of confirmed, death and recovery numbers are given below. 


```{r,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,paged.print=FALSE}

total_confirmed_value<-sum(confirmed_ecuador_corona$cases,na.rm = TRUE)


total_ddeath_value<-sum(death_ecuador_corona$cases)

total_recovery_value<-sum(recovery_ecuador_corona$cases)



tot_df<-data_frame(Type= "Total Summery",
                   Confirmed=total_confirmed_value,
                   Death=total_ddeath_value,
                   Recovery=total_recovery_value)

### **Comparison the Covid 19 cases of Ecuador with neighbouring countries**



```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}

location<-get_stamenmap(bbox=c(left=-85.649,bottom=-11.711,right=-59.5906,top=6.905 ),maptype="terrain",zoom=5)

ggmap(location)



```

Ecuador shared it’s Land Borders with Brazil, Panama, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile. Brazil, Venezuela, Peru and Colombia have very high population than Ecuador.

```{r,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}

neighbour_country <- coronavirus%>% filter(continent_code == "SA")
select_neighbour_country<-neighbour_country %>%filter(country==c("Ecuador","Brazil","Panama","Peru","Colombia","Venezuela", "Chile"))

```

  
----------------------------------
```{r,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
select_neighbour_country_confirmed<-select_neighbour_country%>%filter(type=="confirmed")
select_neighbour_country_confirmed<-select_neighbour_country_confirmed%>% mutate(cases = replace(cases, which(cases < 0), NA))
f<-ggplot(select_neighbour_country_confirmed,aes(x=date,y=cases,colour=country))+geom_path() + labs(x = "Time",
       y = "Cases",
       title = "Figure 6 : Distribution of Confirmed Cases of neighbour countries" )
ggplotly(f)


```
--------------------------------

```{r,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
select_neighbour_country_death<-select_neighbour_country%>%filter(type=="death")
select_neighbour_country_death<-select_neighbour_country_death%>% mutate(cases = replace(cases, which(cases < 0), NA))
t<-ggplot(select_neighbour_country_death,aes(x=date,y=cases,colour=country))+geom_line() + labs(x = "Time",
       y = "Cases",
       title = "Figure 7 : Distribution of Death Cases of neighbour countries")
ggplotly(t)

```

Significantly Raising of death cases in first 10 month in 2021
  
  
--------------------------------
```{r,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
select_neighbour_country<-select_neighbour_country%>% mutate(cases = replace(cases, which(cases < 0), NA),cases != "death")


z<-ggplot(select_neighbour_country, aes(date, cases,colour = country)) + geom_path(size=1) + facet_grid(rows= vars(type)) +
  labs(title="Figure 8 : Daily Confirmed, Death and Recovered cases in Neighbour Countries")
ggplotly(z)

```
Comparing with the neighbor countries Venezuela & Colombia have more confirmed and recovery counts. There is a significant increase of confirmation counts in every neighbour country in early 2021


### **Conclusions** :-
* Ecuador couldn’t control the spread of the virus in end of the 2021 due to virus grown unexpectedly, but recovering of the patients is bit satisfactory.
Active cases graph and Confirmed cases graph almost exactly same by shape but differ from values
Comparing to other continents , Ecuador and other neighbour countries have low no of death counts
By mid of May Ecuador’s total active cases are way less than Peru’s total active cases


### **Discussion** :-
* The Main Target  of this report is get a brief idea about the COVID-19 effect on Ecuador. All the  data visualizations and interpretations are done from the given coronavirus data set . In this report we mainly examined about the confirmed,deaths and recovered cases in Ecuador.On confirmed cases there is a negative cases reported. Next we analyzied the data with the effect on neighboring countries such as Peru, Colombia, Brazil ,etc. Finally we can say Ecuador is still a victim of COVID-19 outbreak.
