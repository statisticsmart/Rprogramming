# Why statistical hypothesis testing is important?

--

Hypothesis testing provides a **reliable framework** for making any **data-driven** decisions for your **population of interest**.

# Do 12.5kg gas cylinders actually hold 12.5kg of weight?

---
# Step 1

Establish null and alternative hypotheses

$$H_1: \mu < 12.5kg$$

---

# Step 1

Establish null and alternative hypotheses

$$H_0: \mu \geq 12.5kg$$

$$H_1: \mu < 12.5kg$$

# Step 2: Gather sample data

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
library(tibble)
gas <- tibble(weight = rnorm(35, mean=10, sd=1))
```

```{r}
gas
```

---
# Step 3: Visualize data

```{r, fig.height=3}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(gas, aes(x=weight)) +  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.5)
```

---

```{r, fig.height=3}
ggplot(gas, aes(x=weight)) +  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.5) +
  theme( # remove axis text and ticks
    axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank()) + labs(x="weight")
```


---

# Step 4: Determine the appropriate statistical test

$$n > 30$$

Central Limit Theorem

---
Distribution of data unknown/ If sample size is small, perform normality test.

### Method 1

 H0: The data  are normally distributed.

 H1: The data  are not normally distributed.
 
 
---

### Method 2

Let $X$ be the weight of a randomly selected cylinder

H0: $X$ is normally distributed

H1: $X$ is not normally distributed

---

# Normal-probability plot

```{r, fig.height=3}
ggplot(gas, aes(sample = weight)) +
    stat_qq() + stat_qq_line(col="red") + coord_equal() + ylab("Theoretical Quantiles") + xlab("Sample Quantiles")
```

How to perform normality test in R?

```{r}
#perform shapiro-wilk test
shapiro.test(gas$weight)
```

# Step 5: Test

"The R package `statsr` provides functions and datasets to support the Coursera Statistics with R Specialization videos and open access book An Introduction to Bayesian Thinking for learning Bayesian and frequentist statistics using R"

# `statsr` package installation

```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("statswithr/statsr",
                  dependencies=TRUE,
                      upgrade_dependencies = TRUE)

Method 1: Using `statsr` package

```{r}
library(statsr)
inference(weight, data=gas, statistic="mean", type="ht", null=12.5,
          alternative ="less", method="theoretical")
```

---

```{r, echo=FALSE}
inference(weight, data=gas, statistic="mean", type="ht", null=12.5,
          alternative ="less", method="theoretical")
```

---

# Confidence intervals with `statsr`

```{r}
inference(weight, data=gas, statistic="mean", type="ci",  method="theoretical")
```

---

# Method 2: Using `stats` package

```{r}
t.test(gas$weight, mu=12.5, alternative = "less")
```


---

# Confidence intervals with `stats`

```{r}
t.test(gas$weight, mu=12.5, alternative = "two.sided")
```


---

# Example 2

A chemist wants to measure the bias in a pH meter. She uses the meter to measure the pH in 14 neutral
substances (pH=7) and obtains the data below.

```{r}
ph <- c( 7.01, 7.04, 6.97, 7.00, 6.99, 6.97, 7.04, 7.04, 7.01, 7.00, 6.99, 7.04, 7.07, 6.97)
```

Is there sufficient evidence to support the claim that the pH meter is not correctly calibrated at the α = 0.05
level of significance?

---

```{r}
ph.df <- data.frame(pH=ph)
ggplot(ph.df, aes(y=pH, x="")) +
geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, fill="forestgreen") +
geom_jitter(alpha=0.5) +
labs(x = "")
```

---

In this case, we have only sixteen observations, meaning that the Central Limit Theorem does not apply.
With a small sample, we should only use the t-test if we can reasonably assume that the population data is
normally distributed. Hence, we must first verify that pH is normally distributed.

---

```{r}
ggplot(ph.df,
aes(sample=pH))+
stat_qq() + stat_qq_line()+labs(x="Theoretical Quantiles", y="Sample Quantiles") +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1)
```

---

```{r}
shapiro.test(ph.df$pH)
```

---


# Hypothesis to be tested

$$H_0: \mu = 7$$

$$H_1: \mu \neq 7$$

$\mu$ - Population mean pH value (in neutral substances).

---
### Hypothesis test

```{r, fig.height=3}
inference(y=pH, data=ph.df, statistic="mean", type="ht", null=12.5,
          alternative ="twosided", method="theoretical")
```

---

### Hypothesis test

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
inference(y=pH, data=ph.df, statistic="mean", type="ht", null=12.5,
          alternative ="twosided", method="theoretical")
```

---

# Confidence interval

```{r}
inference(y=pH, data=ph.df, statistic="mean", type="ci",  method="theoretical")
```

# Confidence interval

## Two-sample: Paired t-test

A dietician hopes to reduce a person’s cholesterol level by using a special diet supplemented with a combination
of vitamin pills. Twenty (20) subjects were pre-tested and then placed on diet for two weeks. Their cholesterol
levels were checked after the two week period. The results are shown below. Cholesterol levels are measured
in milligrams per decilitre.

---
cont. 

i) Test the claim that the Cholesterol level before the special diet is greater than the Cholesterol level
after the special diet at α = 0.01 level of significance.

ii) Construct 99% confidence interval for the difference in mean cholesterol levels. Assume that the
cholesterol levels are normally distributed both before and after.

---

```{r}
id <- 1:20
before <- c(210, 235, 208, 190, 172, 244, 211, 235, 210,
190, 175, 250, 200, 270, 222, 203, 209, 220, 250, 280)
after <- c(190, 170, 210, 188, 173, 195, 228, 200, 210, 184,
196, 208, 211, 212, 205, 221, 240, 250, 230, 220)
cholesterol_1 <- tibble(id=id, before=before, after=after)
head(cholesterol_1)
```

---

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
cholesterol_2 <- pivot_longer(cholesterol_1, before:after, "type", "value")
head(cholesterol_2)
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(data= cholesterol_2, aes(x=type, y=value)) +
geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, aes(fill=type), alpha=0.5) +
geom_jitter(aes(fill=type))
```

---

```{r}
cholesterol_2 %>%
group_by(type) %>%
summarize(mean = round(mean(value), 2),
sd = round(sd(value), 2))
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(data = cholesterol_2, aes(sample = value)) +
stat_qq() +
stat_qq_line() +
facet_grid(. ~ type)
```

---



```{r}
shapiro.test(cholesterol_1$before)
shapiro.test(cholesterol_1$after)
```

---

Method 1: stats package

```{r}
t.test(before, after, data=cholesterol_1, "greater", paired=TRUE)

```

---

Method 2: statsr package

```{r, fig.height=2.7}
diff <- cholesterol_1$before -cholesterol_1$after
diff_data <- data.frame(diff=diff)
ggplot(diff_data, aes(sample=diff))+
stat_qq() + stat_qq_line()+
labs(x="Theoretical Quantiles", y="Sample Quantiles") +  theme(aspect.ratio=1)

```


---

```{r, fig.height=2.7}

inference(y=diff,  data=diff_data,statistic="mean",  type="ht", method="theoretical", alternative ="greater", null=0L)
```

---

Method 2: stats

```{r}
t.test(x = diff_data$diff, alternative = c("greater"), mu=0)
```
