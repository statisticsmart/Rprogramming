# The Method of Monte Carlo

# 1. Introduction

# 2. Applications



## 2.1 Monte Carlo Integration




## 2.2 Hypothesis testing based on simulations

**Steps: **

Let N be the number of simulations.

1. Set $k=1$ and $I = 0$.

2. Simulate a random sample of size $n$ from the distribution X and compute the test statistic $t$.

3. If $\text{test statistic} > \text{critical value}$, increase $I$ by 1.

4. Repeat the process until $k=N$
