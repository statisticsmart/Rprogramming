# Data import with readr

## R package

`readr`: part of the core tidyverse.

```{r,comment=NA}
library(tidyverse)
```

## `readr` data import functions

- `read_csv`: reads comma-delimited files.

- `read_csv2`: reads semicolon-separated files

- `read_tsv`: reads tab-delimited files

# ðŸ›  Import data from a .csv file


## Syntax


```r
datasetname <- read_csv("include_file_path")
```

When you run `read_csv`, it prints out the names and type of each column.

# ðŸ›  Importing csv file from a website

## Syntax

```r
datasetname <- read_csv("include url here")
```

## Example

```{r, comment=NA, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://thiyanga.netlify.app/project/datasets/foodlabel.csv"
foodlabel <- read_csv(url)
```

```{r,comment=NA}
head(foodlabel, 1)
```

# `read.csv` and `read_csv`

*  `read.csv` is in base R.

*  `read_csv` is in tidyverse.

*  `read.csv()` performs a similar job to `read_csv()`.

* `read_csv()` works well with other parts of the tidyverse.

*  `read_csv()` is faster than `read.csv()`.

*  `read_csv()` will always read variables containing text as character variable.  In contrast, the base R function `read.csv()` will, by default, convert any character variable to a factor.

<!--This is often not what you want, and can be overridden by passing the option stringsAsFactors = FALSE to read.csv().-->

# ðŸ›  Writing to a File

- We can save tibble (or dataframe) to a csv file, using `write_csv()`.

- `write_csv()` is in the `readr` package.


## Syntax

```r
write_csv(name_of_the_data_set_you_want_to_save, "path_to_write_to")
```

## Example

```r
data(iris)
# This will save inside your project folder
write_csv(iris, "iris.csv") 
# This will save inside the data folder which is inside your project folder
write_csv(iris, "data/iris.csv") 
```

mydata <- read_xlsx("file_path")
```

# Importing SAS, SPSS and STATA files

## SAS

```r
read_sas("mtcars.sas7bdat")
write_sas(mtcars, "mtcars.sas7bdat")
```
## SPSS

```r
read_sav("mtcars.sav")
write_sav(mtcars, "mtcars.sav")

```
## Stata
```r
read_dta("mtcars.dta")
write_dta(mtcars, "mtcars.dta")
```

# Importing other types of data


- `feather`: for sharing with Python and other languages

- `httr`: for web apis

- `jsonlite`: for JSON

- `rvest`: for web scraping

- `xml2`: for XML
