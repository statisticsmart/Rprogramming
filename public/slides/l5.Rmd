# Monty Hall Problem: Rules

- The host must always open a door that was not picked by the contestant.

--

- The host must always open a door to reveal a goat and never the car.

--

- The host must always offer the chance to switch between the originally chosen door and the remaining closed door.

# Does switching increases the chance of winning the car?


---

We use `sample` function to assign `car`, `goat`, `goat`, behind the doors.

```{r, comment=NA}
sample(c("car", "goat", "goat"))

sample(c("car", "goat", "goat"))
```

--
Here is a function that will take player's initial choice of door.

```{r, comment=NA}
select_first_door <- function(door){
  door.allocation <- sample(c("car", "goat", "goat"))
  door.allocation[door]
}

select_first_door(2) # My first choice is the 2nd door
```

--

Modify your function so that it shows the player the door that the host selects. Hint: `sample` function act as a host.

---

Modify your function so that it includes the player strategy (switch or stay) as an input, and returns the appropriate result.

- Run your function 1000 times, for each strategy and report the proportion of times that car is selected. (You could put this
in a loop and compute the proportion of times car shows.) 
- How many times would you expect car to be selected out of 1000 runs?

# Approximating Pi = 3.14616

$$\frac{A_{circle}}{A_{square}}=\frac{\pi r^2}{4r^2}$$
Equation of a circle center around 0: $x^2+y^2=r^2$

# Random Variable Generation: Inverse-Transform Method

Let $X$ be a random variable with CDF $F$. Since $F$ is a nondecreasing function, the inverse function $F^{-1}$ may be defined as
$$F^{-1}(y)=inf\{x: F(x)\geq y\}, 0 \leq y \leq 1.$$

It is easy to show that if $U \sim U(0, 1)$, then

$$X=F^{-1}(U)$$

has CDF $F$. Namely, since $F$ is invertible and $P(U \leq u)=u$, we have

$$P(X \leq x)=P(F^{-1}(U)\leq x)=P(U\leq F(x))=F(x)$$
