# Introduction to R Markdown

- Markdown is one of the world's most popular markup language.

- R Markdown (in R)

- Jupyter Notebooks (in Python)
---

# Advantages

1. For .bold[.green[communicating]] to .bold[.red[decision makers]], who want to focus on the results and conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.

1. For .bold[.green[collaborating]] with other .bold[.red[data scientists]], who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e. the codes that you used to take the outputs).

# Chunk options

* `eval = FALSE` - prevents the code from being evaluated

* `include = FALSE` - runs the code but doesn't show it in the final document

* `echo = FALSE` - prevents the code but not the results from appearing

* `message = FALSE` - prevents messages from appearing in the finished file

* `results = "hide"` - hides the printed output

* `error = TRUE` - causes the render to continue even if the code returns an error
