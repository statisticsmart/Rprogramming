## 3. Bahrain under Covid-19 Pandemic

Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) was first discovered in Wuhan,
China in November, 2019. It has a high capability to spread from 
one person to another person via nasal or oral droplets and aerosols 
containing the virus. Due to this reason, the disease was quickly spread 
worldwide and it was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO) by March, 2020. Global governments did not hesitate 
to impose strict rules and regulations to control the spread of the virus
as much as possible. \
In Bahrain, the first patient infected by the corona virus was 
identified in February, 2020. 
Within next few days considerable amount of patients, mostly 
among air-passengers enter the country, were identified. 
Therefore the Bahraini government officials suspended public gatherings 
including schools, universities, shopping malls etc.By the March, 2020 Bahrain
started witnessing an increasing growth in Covid-19 patients therefore the 
government took several necessary steps to avoid the spread by turning large centers to isolations centers and starting private healthcare facilities for people who were willing to undergo treatments on their own expenses. The Bahraini government appointed National Task Force for Combating Coronavirus to make more precise and accurate desicions in order to defeat the pandemic in Bahrain. The task force introduced _BeAware Bahrain_, a Cloud based mobile application to track and treat infected patients more efficiently. In the mean time the government imposed lockdown curfews and introduced new laws to minimize public gathering to avoid the transmission of the disease.  The vaccination program in Bahrain started in January, 2021. The authorities prioritized vaccinating the Bahraini people as the best precaution against Covid-19 virus. Currently 6 vaccines are used in Bahrain and according to WHO 70% of the country's population (including non-nationals) has received both doses of Covid-19 vaccines free of charge.

### 3.2 Reported Active, Recovered and Death cases from 22/01/2020 to 18/09/2021

After the first Covid-19 infected person was reported in February, 2020, it can be observed that reported numbers of different type of cases (confirmed, death and recovered) show varying patterns in time to time. In all three types of cases, the relevant highest-peaks can be observed in May-June, 2021. **Figure 05** the shows number of cases reported under types 'confirmed', 'recovered' and 'death'. The line plots of confirmed cases and recovered cases have approximately similar patterns  **Table 01** displays the highest number of cases recorded under each type. Apart from the highest peaks which have occurred in May-June, 2021, two small peaks for each curve can be observed between July and November in 2020. This feature indicates that Bahrain has been through two waves of Covid-19(periods in which increasing numbers of cases have been recorded in a short time interval). Compared to the number of confirmed and recovered cases it is little bit difficult to get an idea on how the number of deaths have varied across the time period observing **Figure05**. A clear observations on the variation of reported number of deaths can be obtained using **Figure06**. The plot of number of deaths varies almost the same as two other plots, showing the highest peak between May-June, 2021. In both **Figure05** and **Figure06**, it is possible to observe that by the months of August-September, 2021, how all plots have reached the minimum number of cases since the first recorded. There is a high chance that the rapid vaccination programs conducted across Bahrain making a strong impact to control Covid-19 pandemic. 

```{r, comment=NA}
Type <- c("Confirmed", "Recovered", "Deaths")
Date <- c("29/05/2021", "05/06/2021", "01/06/2021")
Cases <- c(3273, 3651, 29)
Bah <- data.frame(Type, Date, Cases)

```

## 4. Covid-19 Pandemic in Gulf Countries


As an island nation situated in the Persian gulf, Bahrain is surrounded by some Arabian nations such as Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar etc. To conduct a comparison among Bahrain and other Gulf States during the Covid-19 pandemic, two countries were chosen based on the recorded number of Covid-19 cases. Kuwait and Qatar has shown approximately equal number of confirmed number of Covid-19 cases between 22/01/2020 and 18/09/2021. When comparing the three countries (**Figure07**), Bahrain has reported the most number of cases. Kuwait and Bahrain have showed the highest respective peaks in the months of May-June,2021. During that time interval Qatar too has shown a peak yet it is much shorter than the highest peak which Qatar has reached in May,2020.




![**Figure07: Confirmed Covid-19 cases of Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar**](Rplot3.png)




Considering the number of deaths recorded in each of selected countries, by observing **Figure08** it is fair to state that Bahrain has recorded that highest number of death troll due to Covid-19 and the lowest number was recorded by Qatar. All three countries have reached the highest peaks of the respective plots roughly at the same time point. Currently the countries have started to record the low amounts of death trolls. If the countries are able continue the disease control, soon it would be possible to witness flatten curves.

## 5. Conclusions

* In Bahrain, the highest number of Covid-19 cases recorded is 3273 and the highest number of deaths recorded is 29 in a single day.

* Bahrain is conducting a rapid vaccination program, thereby maintaining the spread of the disease at a commendable level.
