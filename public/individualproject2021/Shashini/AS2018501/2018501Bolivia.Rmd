### Climate in Bolivia

<p align="justify"> Bolivia's climate varies drastically from one ecosystem to another, from the tropics of eastern llanos to the polar climate of the western Andes.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

### COVID-19 cases in Bolivia

<p align="justify">The below graph shows the confirmed, death, and recovered COVID-19 cases in Bolivia. Since the beginning, the number of COVID-19 cases in Bolivia has risen sharply. Significantly, the death toll has dropped compared to confirmed cases. Also, the recovery rate in Bolivia is considerably higher.</p>

### COVID-19 Vaccination in Bolivia

<p align="justify">The COVID-19 vaccine is a vaccine that was given to provide immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2).</p>

<p align="justify">The government of the newly elected President Luis Arce signed an agreement between Bolivia and Russia on December 30, 2020, to receive 5.2 million doses of the Sputnik-V vaccine. The vaccine was approved by the Bolivian regulator based on phase III clinical trials in Russia. The first 20,000 doses of the vaccine arrived on January 28, 2021. In January 2021, the government entered into an agreement with the Serum Institute of India to provide 5 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.</p>

<p align="justify">Bolivia has given at least 6,443,148 doses of COVID vaccines so far. It is enough to vaccinate about 28% of the country's population. The normalized daily number of cases and the aggregate number of fully vaccinated people in Bolivia are graphically shown below.</p>
<br>

```{r}
data("covid19_vaccine")
bolivia_cases <- coronavirus %>% 
  filter(country == "Bolivia", 
         type == "confirmed") %>%

         people_fully_vaccinated_normilized = (people_fully_vaccinated - min(people_fully_vaccinated, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
           (max(people_fully_vaccinated, na.rm = TRUE) - 
              min(people_fully_vaccinated, na.rm = TRUE)))

plot_ly(data = bolivia_cases,
        x = ~ date,
        y = ~ cases_normalized,
        type = "scatter",
        mode = "line",
        name = "Daily Cases (Normalized)") %>%
  add_lines(x = ~ date,
            y = ~ people_fully_vaccinated_normilized,
            name = "Fully Vaccinated - Aggregate (Normalized)") %>%
  layout(title = "Bolivia - Daily New Cases vs. Total Vaccinated Population (Normalized)",
         legend = list(orientation = 'h'),
         yaxis = list(title = "Normalized Daily Cases/Total Vaccinated"),
         xaxis = list(title = ""),
         margin = list(b = 60))
```

<p align="justify">Based on the last week reported, Bolivia has vaccinated on average 18,588 doses per day. And it is estimated that it would take another 124 days to vaccine another 10% of the population at that rate.</p>

# Discussion

<p align="justify">From the beginning of the spread of the pandemic, the Bolivian government implemented necessary actions to control the situation. The Bolivian government announced seven measures on March 12, 2020 to slow the spread of the COVID-19 disease, including suspending education in schools and universities until March 21 and suspending flights to and from Europe from March 14. The city of Oruro declared a 14-day quarantine from March 16, 2020, due to six confirmed COVID-19 cases reported. Interim President Jeanine Áñez prohibited anyone coming from China, South Korea, Italy, or Spain to enter Bolivia from March 14. On March 17, the President announced that Bolivia's borders would be closed to all foreign nationals from March 19. The Bolivian government suspended all international flights from March 20, 2020, and banned domestic travel between departments and provinces. The government announced a 14-day nationwide quarantine with effect from midnight on March 22. On March 25, a public health emergency was declared in the country, and its borders were completely locked down, allowing no one to enter or leave except for health or security reasons. The Bolivian government extended the quarantine from time to time.</p>

<p align="justify">The source of this data is the Coronavirus from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The data set used for this analysis is the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) data set, which is readily available as a package installed on RStudio. The coronavirus package provides a data set of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) pandemic and the vaccination by country. Negative values may occur in the data due to the calculation of the daily cases from the raw data, and in some cases, removing false-positive cases.</p> 

<p align="justify">Overall COVID-19 cases in Bolivia is relatively low when compared to neighboring countries. Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Peru have been highly affected by the pandemic compared to other countries in their region. Brazil is one of the most COVID-19 impacted countries in the world. With the geographical location, Bolivia is surrounded by the countries that are highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of COVID-19 cases in Bolivia has risen sharply from March 2020. COVID-19 cases reached their peak in Bolivia in July 2020, January 2021, and June 2021. Actions taken by the government were effective in controlling the spread of the pandemic in the country. Today, the number of COVID-19 cases in Bolivia is declining.</p>

# Conclusion

<p align="justify">As of today, the Bolivian government has the situation under control. Bolivia has managed the COVID-19 pandemic significantly better than its neighboring countries in the region(Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Peru). Also, Bolivia is in a significantly better status in the pandemic compared to many countries globally. Strategies and actions taken by the Bolivian government were successful even if Bolivia is bordered by highly impacted countries by the pandemic.</p>
