**Lebanon**, country located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea; it consists of a narrow strip of territory and is one of the world’s smaller sovereign states. The capital is Beirut.
Though Lebanon, particularly its coastal region, was the site of some of the oldest human settlements in the world—the Phoenician ports of Tyre (modern Ṣūr), Sidon (Ṣaydā), and Byblos (Jubayl) were dominant centres of trade and culture in the 3rd millennium BCE—it was not until 1920 that the contemporary state came into being. In that year France, which administered Lebanon as a League of Nations mandate, established the state of Greater Lebanon. Lebanon then became a republic in 1926 and achieved independence in 1943.
Lebanon shares many of the cultural characteristics of the Arab world, yet it has attributes that differentiate it from many of its Arab neighbours. Its rugged, mountainous terrain has served throughout history as an asylum for diverse religious and ethnic groups and for political dissidents. Lebanon is one of the most densely populated countries in the Mediterranean area and has a high rate of literacy. Notwithstanding its meagre natural resources, Lebanon long managed to serve as a busy commercial and cultural centre for the Middle East.

Lebanon sharing boards to the north and east with Syrian Arab Republic, and to the south with Israel/Palestinian Territory. The country possesses four distinct zones from west to east including the coastal plain, the Mount Lebanon Range, the Bekaa Valley and the Anti Lebanon range that forms its boarder with Syria. Lebanon is a mountainous country with approximately half of its landscape lying at an altitude of over 900m (3000ft).For its relatively diminutive size, Lebanon offers a surprisingly diverse landscape from the fertile Bekaa Valley to the snow capped peaks of the Anti Lebanon and cedar forest of Mount Lebanon. The famous ceder tree grow high in the mountains, while the lower slopes are cultived with grapes, apricots, plums, peaches, figs, olives and barley, often on terraces painstakingly cut out from the mountainsides. On the coastal plain, citrus fruit, bananas and vegetable are also grown.

There are sharp local contrasts in the country’s climatic conditions. Lebanon is included in the Mediterranean climatic region, which extends westward to the Atlantic Ocean. Winter storms formed over the ocean move eastward through the Mediterranean, bringing precipitation at that season; in summer, however, the Mediterranean receives little or no precipitation. The climate of Lebanon is generally subtropical and is characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, humid winters. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from the low 90s F (low 30s C) in July to the low 60s F (mid-10s C) on the coast and low 50s F (low 10s C) in Al-Biqāʿ in January. Mean minimum temperatures in January are in the low 50s F on the coast and the mid-30s F (about 2 °C) in Al-Biqāʿ. At 5,000 feet (1,524 metres), the elevation of the highest settlements, these are reduced by about 15 °F (8 °C).

Nearly all precipitation falls in winter, averaging 30 to 40 inches (750 to 1,000 mm) on the coast and rising to more than 50 inches (1,270 mm) in higher altitudes. Al-Biqāʿ is drier and receives 15 to 25 inches (380 to 640 mm). On the higher mountaintops, this precipitation falls as heavy snow that remains until early summer.

Lebanon has confirmed cases of COVID-19 within its borders.  At present, businesses and public institutions in Lebanon are operating under regular business hours and no restrictions on capacity.   There are no limits on attendance for religious services.  There is no current government mandate for mask wearing but individual private and commercial establishments may have their own requirements.  Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport remains open. All air travelers over age 12 arriving in Beirut are required to undergo PCR testing upon arrival.

**CoronaVirus and China**

Coronavirus disease, originated at Wuhan city of China in early December 2019 has rapidly widespread with confirmed cases in almost every country across the world and has become a new global public health crisis. The etiological agent was designated as Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was originated in bats and human transmission primarily occurs through direct, indirect, or close contact with infected people through infected secretions such as respiratory secretions, saliva or through respiratory droplets that are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. The World Health Organization coined the term COVID-19 and declared this novel coronavirus disease as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The virus is highly contagious and the incubation period ranges between 2-14 days. The virus infects the human respiratory epithelial cells by binding through Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Many infected people are either asymptomatic or develop a mild respiratory illness. The major clinical symptoms of the disease are fever, non-productive cough, fatigue, malaise, and breathlessness. Severe illness such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death occurs in the elderly and patients with comorbid conditions. The case fatality rate is estimated to be 2-3%. The rapid surge was observed in new cases and COVID-19 related deaths outside of China since the beginning of March-2020. As of June 8, 2020 more than 7 million confirmed cases and > 400 thousand deaths were reported from 213 countries and territories. The disease is mainly diagnosed by the detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swab or Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) by polymerase chain reaction reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Treatment is basically symptomatic and supportive. Several vaccines are still under various stages of clinical trials. Remdesivir was the first antiviral drug approved for treatment but its efficacy is yet to be determined. At present preventive measures such as contact, droplet, and airborne precautions are the main strategy to control the spread of the disease.

The covidvirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has grown rapidly in Lebanon. The highest number of patients in Lebanon was reported in February 2021. The highest number of deaths was reported in early March 2021.
The United States has the highest Covid-19 distribution among the 5 countries. Populations similar between Lebanon and Libya but more widespread in Lebanon. But shows a greater density of patients in Lebanon. The largest number of deaths has been reported from the United States.Although the spread of the virus has decreased in Libya, China, and the United States, the spread of the virus has increased in Lebanon in recent times.
