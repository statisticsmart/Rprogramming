Kosovo is the European country as shown above.Kosovo, self-declared independent country in the Balkans region of Europe.


###  Climate condition of Kosovo
The climate of Kosovo is predominantly continental, resulting in warm summers and cold winters with Mediterranean and Alpine influences (average temperature within the country range from +30 °C (summer) to –10 °C (winter)). However, due to unequal elevations in certain parts of the country, there are differences in temperature and rainfall distribution.
December and January are regarded as the coldest months, July and August as the warmest months of the year. The maximum rainfall rate is reached between October and December. Between November and March, snowfall can be expected in Kosovo, even in the flat parts of the country. The highest snowfall rates can be expected in the mountain regions of Kosovo.
The valley between Mitrovica and Kaçanik belongs to the dryer areas of the country. In contrast, the plain of Dukagjini between Peja and Prizren is described as a very fertile area with more precipitation between November and March.
Based on the climate conditions, Kosovo can be separated into three climatic areas:

 + Climatic Area of Kosovo (Kosovo Plain),
 + Climatic Area of Dukagjini (Dukagjini Plain) and
 + Climatic Area of mountains and forest parts.

The climatic area of Kosovo (Kosovo Plain), which includes the Iber valley, is influenced by continental air masses. For this reason, in this part of the country, the winters are colder with medium temperatures above –10 °C, but sometimes down to –26 °C. The summers are very hot with average temperatures of 20 °C, sometimes up to 37 °C. This area is characterized by a dry climate and a total annual precipitation of 600 mm per year, approximately.
The climatic area of Dukagjini (Dukagjini Plain), which includes the watershed of the Drini i Bardh river, is influenced very much by the hot air masses, which cross the Adriatic Sea. Medium temperatures during winter range from 0.5 °C to sometimes 22.8 °C. The average annual precipitation of this climatic area is about 700 mm per year. The winter is characterized by heavy snowfalls.

### Lock-down status of the Kosovo
Since the first COVID-19 case was registered in Kosovo on 13 March 2020.The Kosovar government on  july 28 2020 imposed most of the previous lockdown measures, such as banning religious ceremonies and other activities, in an effort to prevent an alarming escalation of coronavirus cases.In these day the government ordered that public gatherings, including family traditional ceremonies and mass gathering of more than five people, were banned in squares or parks. Restaurants, cafes, night clubs cannot operate during 10.30 p.m. until 5 a.m.Citizens from neighboring Western Balkan countries where new virus cases had risen too need to present a negative virus test to enter the country.Citizens were advised to wear the mask in all closed buildings or spaces and institutions and companies should create the proper social distancing environment for the employees.
While the number of new COVID-19 cases in Kosovo rose sharply in November 2020, with a weekly average of 715 new cases, the number started to significantly decline from mid-December. In January, Kosovo recorded a weekly average of 300 new cases, bringing the total number of reported cases to more than 58 000 since the beginning of the epidemic.Regarding measures put in place to help contain the spread of the virus, restrictions on freedom of movement remain in place across the country for people over the age of 65, who are only permitted to leave the house between 06:00-10:00 and 16:00-19:00. Weddings and religious ceremonies
continue to be prohibited, while funerals may only be conducted with immediate family members.Since 23 December 2020 , controls at the borders also remain in force with both Kosovo citizens and most foreign nationals still required to present a negative PCR test when entering Kosovo, or undergo a seven-day self-isolation period following arrival.
 On 15 January 2021, regulations governing public gatherings have, however, been relaxed throughout Kosovo. The number of people permitted to gather in public spaces such as parks, squares and recreational centers has been extended from four to fifty. With Kosovo’s parliamentary election scheduled for 14 February 2021, a special mention is also made for public rallies, which must be limited to
50 persons.
 Municipalities have continued to be designated as low, medium or high risk depending on the number of infected inhabitants (<75, 76-170, >150 infected individuals per 100 000 inhabitants respectively). 
Depending on their classification, municipalities face different measures. In low and medium-risk municipalities, operating hours for businesses, shopping centers and cultural institutions have now
been extended by two hours to between 05:00 and 22:00. In high-risk municipalities, a curfew remains in force but has been pushed back, now applying from 21:30 until 05:00.

### Actions taken by the government 
Acting Prime Minister announced that vaccinations against COVID-19 began in last February, with health professionals, people over the age of 65 and at-risk groups being the first to received the vaccine. Estimations are that 20 000 citizens will be vaccinated per day. Agreements were reached with Pfizer/BioNTech, COVAX, and the Austrian state to provide vaccines.

summary(Kosovo_corona)
```

Above table show as Kosovo_corona is consist of the number of confirmed, death and recovered covid-19 patients from 2020-01-22 to  2021-09-18 of the Kosovo and the location of the Kosovo country in the worlds map shown with it's latitude and longitude.It is located with 20.9 longitute and 42.6 latitude.


### Visualization of death, confirmed, recovered, active cases 

#### death cases

```{r}
death_cases <- filter(Kosovo_corona, type == "death")
death_cases$cases[is.na(death_cases$cases)]<-mean(death_cases$cases,
                                                          na.rm=TRUE)
death_cases$cases<-round(death_cases$cases,digits=0)
ggplot(death_cases,aes(x=date,y= cases))+ geom_path(size=1) + labs(title = "Death cases in Kosovo")
```

Above graph shows the death number of covid-19 patients in Kosovo in daily basis. It shows that number of death covid-19 patients has been increasing and  decreasing.Overall idea of the above graph,Higher death cases in country Kosovo  can be see since oct 2020 to june 2021.

#### confirmed cases

![Kosovo confirms first coronavirus cases](https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2020/03/13/thumbs_b_c_c1e1072042a81867e102de53bf4dbf14.jpg?v=223129){width=60%}

```{r}
confirmed_cases <- filter(Kosovo_corona, type == "confirmed")
confirmed_cases$cases[is.na(confirmed_cases$cases)]<-mean(confirmed_cases$cases,
                                                          na.rm=TRUE)
confirmed_cases$cases<-round(confirmed_cases$cases,digits=0)
ggplot(confirmed_cases,aes(x=date,y= cases,colour = 'red')) + geom_path(size=1) + labs(title = "Confirmed cases in Kosovo")
```

Above graph shows the confirmed number of covid-19 patients in Kosovo in daily basis. It shows that number of confirmed covid-19 patients has been increasing and  decreasing.Overall idea of the above graph,Higher confirmed cases in country Kosovo  can be see since after oct 2020.

#### recovered cases

```{r}
recovered_cases <- filter(Kosovo_corona, type == "recovered")
recovered_cases$cases[is.na(recovered_cases$cases)]<-mean(recovered_cases$cases,
                                                          na.rm=TRUE)

#### active cases

```{r}
Kosovo_corona_wider<-Kosovo_corona%>%pivot_wider(names_from = "type",values_from = "cases")
Kosovo_corona_wider<-Kosovo_corona_wider%>%mutate(active=cumsum(confirmed)-cumsum(death)-cumsum(recovered))
Kosovo_corona_wider$active<-replace(Kosovo_corona_wider$active,Kosovo_corona_wider$active<0,0)
ggplot(Kosovo_corona_wider, aes(date, active)) + geom_path(size=1) + labs(title = "Active cases in Kosovo")
```

Above graph shows the active number of covid-19 patients in Kosovo in daily basis. It shows that the number of active covid-19 patients has been increasing and  decreasing.Overall idea of the above graph,the higher active cases in country Kosovo can be see since oct 2020 to jun 2021.


```{r}
ggplot(Kosovo_corona, aes(date, cases)) + geom_path(size=1) + facet_grid(rows = vars(type)) +
  labs(title = "Confirmed, Death and Recovered cases in Kosovo")

ggplot(Kosovo_corona, aes(x = date, y = cases, colour = type)) + geom_path(size=1) + 
  labs(title="Confirmed, Death and Recovered cases in Kosovo")
```

Above graph shows the number of confirmed, death and recovered covid-19 patients in Kosovo in daily basis in the same graph. This graph shows that number of patients confirming with covid-19 in a day and number of covid-19 patients recovery in a day has still increased.But number of death cases has  still in the lower level over the time period comparing with  the number of patients confirming with covid-19 in a day. So,still the this situation has not controlled by the Kosovo and still the its spreading rapidly.

```{r}
Kosovo_corona<-  Kosovo_corona%>%
  group_by(type)%>%
  mutate(cum_cases = cumsum(cases))

ggplot(Kosovo_corona, aes(date, cum_cases, colour = type)) + geom_path(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Total number of confirmed, death, recovered cases in Kosovo")
```

Above graph implies that the total number of covid-19 confirmed cases and covid-19 recovered cases has increased exponentially.Covid-19 recovered cases had parallely increased with Covid-19 confirmed cases over the time.covid-19 death cases has not showing any special characteristic according to above graph over the time.

```{r}
Kosovo_corona_spread <- spread(select(Kosovo_corona, 1,6,8), key = type, value = cum_cases)

Kosovo_corona_spread$per_confirmed <- (Kosovo_corona_spread$confirmed / Kosovo_corona_spread$confirmed)*100
Kosovo_corona_spread$per_death <- (Kosovo_corona_spread$death / Kosovo_corona_spread$confirmed)*100
Kosovo_corona_spread$per_recovered <- (Kosovo_corona_spread$recovered / Kosovo_corona_spread$confirmed)*100

Kosovo_corona_gather <- gather(Kosovo_corona_spread, key = "type_1" , value = "Per_cum_with_confirmed",5:7)

Kosovo_corona <- cbind.data.frame(Kosovo_corona, select(Kosovo_corona_gather, 5,6))
Kosovo_corona[is.na(Kosovo_corona)] <- 0

ggplot(Kosovo_corona, aes(date, Per_cum_with_confirmed , colour = type)) + geom_path(size=1) +
  labs(title = "Percentage of total death, recovered cases with confirmed cases in Kosovo")
```

Above graph implies the total number of covid-19 death and covid-19 recovered cases as a percentage with  total covid-19 confirmed cases in daily basis.
This implies that percentage of total covid-19 recovered patients with the total number of covid-19 confirmed cases is increasing daily and it in a satisfactory level. Also the percentage of total number of covid-19 death cases with total number of covid-19 confirmed cases is  slowly increasing after 2021.
