## 1. Data

Download the data file from the course website.

Use `readRDS` function to read the file.

```r

facebookdata_marketing <- readRDS("_GIVE_FILE PATH_/facebookdata_marketing.rds")

```

## Your turn (optional)

Explore `here` function in the `here` package.

## 2. Variable description

A manager of a retail company wants to develop a regression model to identify the effect of the following variables (see below) on the total number of `likes`, `comments`, and `shares` on facebook posts.

- **month:** Month the post was published (1, 2, 3, ..., 12)

- **category:** Type of the post (1 - Link, 2 - Video, 3 - Picture)

- **hour:** Hour the post was published (0, 1, ...24)

- **paid:** If the company paid to Facebook for advertising (0 - No, 1 - Yes)

- **totalReach:** Number of people who saw the page post
(unique users).

- **engagedUsers:** Number of people who clicked anywhere
in the post (unique users).

- **postConsumers:** Number of people who sent a direct message to the owner
of the post.

- **postConsumption:** Number of clicks anywhere in the post.

- **sawbyLiked:** Number of people who saw the page post
because they have liked that page.

- **clickbyLiked:** Number of people who have liked the Page
and clicked anywhere in the post.

Dependent variable:

- **totalInteractions:** The sum of “likes,” “comments,” and “shares”
of the post.


## 3. Training test and Test set

```{r, eval=FALSE}
smp_size <- 400

## set the seed to make your partition reproducible
set.seed(123)
train_ind <- sample(seq_len(nrow(facebookdata_marketing)), size = smp_size)
train <- facebookdata_marketing[train_ind, ]
test <- facebookdata_marketing[-train_ind, ]

```

## 4. Questions

1. Perform a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis on `facebookdata_marketing.rds`.

2. Develop a suitable regression model to predict total interactions (The sum of “likes,” “comments,” and “shares”
of the post).

3. Test for significance of regression. What conclusions can you draw?

4. Using $t$ tests, determine the contribution of the regressors in your final model. Discuss your findings.

5. Plot 95% confidence interval for the regression coefficients of the model in part 2.

6. Is multicollinearity a potential concern in the model identified in part 2.

7. Use the model in part 2 to predict each observation in the test test and calculate the out-of-sample accuracy.

8. Prepare a brief report presenting your EDA and regression analysis.
