\noindent\textbf{Learning Outcomes:}
At the end of this course, the student should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0.1mm}
\item navigate the R integrated development environment (IDE) R Studio
\item execute basic arithmetic operations in R
\item define data classes, object attributes, data structures in R
\item describe differences in different data structures
\item write user-defined functions  to solve a given problem in R 
\item solve fundamental error problems and bugs in R programs
\item describe the principles of tidyverse programming
\item use Tidyverse packages in data science workflow 
\item import external data into R for data processing and statistical analysis.
\item organise complex, messy, data into the most convenient form for analysis or reporting.
\item create data graphics using the ggplot2 package
\item select effective visualisation and modelling approaches to understand relationships between variables, and make decisions with data
\item interpret the results of analysis and communicate these to a broad audience.
\item Evaluate several functions that perform the same task and explain which one is better and why?
\item Revise functions/programs to improve the readability and computational efficiency

\end{itemize}
