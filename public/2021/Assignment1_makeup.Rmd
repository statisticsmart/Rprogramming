## Example

**geom_polygon**

`geom_polygon` can be used to draw boundaries for different regions.

```{r, comment=NA, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(tidyverse)
world <- map_data("world")
AUS <- world %>% filter(region == "Australia")
ggplot(AUS) + 
   geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group))
```
