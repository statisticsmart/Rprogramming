```


#### **Administrative divisions** :
<font size="3" > Moldova is divided into 32 districts (raioane, singular raion), three municipalities and two autonomous regions (Gagauzia and Transnistria).The final status of Transnistria is disputed, as the central government does not control that territory. 10 other cities, including Comrat and Tiraspol, the administrative seats of the two autonomous territories, also have municipality status.

Moldova has 66 cities (towns), including 13 with municipality status, and 916 communes. Another 700 villages are too small to have a separate administration and are administratively part of either cities (41 of them) or communes (659). This makes for a total of 1,682 localities in Moldova, two of which are uninhabited.The largest city in Moldova is Chișinău with a population of 635,994 people.</font>



#### **Climate** :
<font size="3" > Moldova has a climate which is moderately continental; its proximity to the Black Sea leads to the climate being mildly cold in the autumn and winter and relatively cool in the spring and summer.</font>

<font size="3" > The summers are warm and long, with temperatures averaging about 20 °C (68 °F) and the winters are relatively mild and dry, with January temperatures averaging −4 °C (25 °F). Annual rainfall, which ranges from around 600 mm (24 in) in the north to 400 mm (16 in) in the south, can vary greatly; long dry spells are not unusual. The heaviest rainfall occurs in early summer and again in October; heavy showers and thunderstorms are common. Because of the irregular terrain, heavy summer rains often cause erosion and river silting.</font>

<font size="3" > The highest temperature ever recorded in Moldova was 41.5 °C (106.7 °F) on 21 July 2007 in Camenca. The lowest temperature ever recorded was −35.5 °C (−31.9 °F) on 20 January 1963 in Brătușeni, Edineț county.</font>

#### **COVID-19 pandemic in Moldova**

<font size="3" > The COVID-19 pandemic in Moldova is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached the Republic of Moldova on 7 March 2020, when a Moldovan woman that returned from Italy was tested positive for the novel coronavirus. As the number of infected people started to rise during the next days, on 17 March 2020 the Parliament declared the state of emergency for the entire territory of the Republic of Moldova for a period of 60 days (17 March - 15 May 2020). On 18 March 2020 the first death caused by COVID-19 was registered.By 10 April 2020, cases had been confirmed in all the regions of the country, including the Transnistrian region.On 15 May 2020, in the last day of the state of emergency declared by the Parliament on 17 March 2020, the Extraordinary National Commission of Public Health declared the state of emergency in public health for the entire territory of the Republic of Moldova for the period of 16 May - 30 June 2020.</font>

#### **Lockdown status and actions taken by the government**

<font size="3" > A Task Force was established at the initial phase of the epidemic. The MoHLSP elaborated a COVID-19 risk communication and community engagement plan covering travel advice, hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, and physical distancing were issued early in the epidemic (February 2020).</font>

<font size="3" > The MoHLSP coordinate and manages the main messages and communications related to COVID-19 and conduct two media briefings per day. The messages and health information are conveyed through most popular channels and tools: TV channels, radio stations, social media, social media influencers, NGOs, visuals in public places. </font>


<font size="3" > In order to effectively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and to better inform the general population, an online platform was launched on 20 March providing real-time data on cases. It was created with support from UNFPA, WHO, UN Resident Coordinator in the Republic of Moldova. </font>


<font size="3" > An overall ban on public events and gatherings of more than 50 people started under this situation.Educational institutions have also been closed and regular studies have been substituted by distance learning.Recreational facilities (gyms, sports centres, swimming pools, fitness rooms, theatres, cinemas, concert halls, museums, shopping centres, restaurants and bars) have been closed and Stores other than grocery and pharmacies were closed. Employers were advised to review their working hours and implement working from home.</font>
  

<font size="3" > From 10 April, suspected COVID-19 cases have been isolated at home. All contacts are told to self-isolated at home with self-monitoring (taking their temperature three times per day and monitoring respiratory symptoms) and informing their primary care doctors (MoHLSP order from 26 February 2020). Self-isolation at home for 14 days was recommended for all contacts.</font>

#### **Conclusion**

<font size="3" >Moldova is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe and it is divided into 32 districts. Moldova has a climate which is moderately continental; its proximity to the Black Sea leads to the climate being mildly cold in the autumn and winter and relatively cool in the spring and summer.

When consider COVID 19 pandemic in Moldova the first coronavirus case was reported on 8 March 2020.
During the period from March 8 to 12 May 2020, there have been 5154 confirmed cases of COVID 19 with 182 deaths.
When consider monthely data, a large number of cases was reported in April.
In the final stages, the situation of this pandemic have been compared with Russia,Bulgaria and United States. According to the information, the situation of United States was very dangoreous. All cases of United States have been increased more than other countries.</font> 

#### **Discussion**
<font size="3" >After analysing the data of Moldova, we can assumed that considerably affcet the COVID 19 pandemic on Moldova. And also United States have been reported most no of cases in the world.</font>
