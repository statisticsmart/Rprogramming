# 1. Introduction
## COVID-19
    
    A cluster of cases of unknown cause pneumonia was reported to the World Health Organization on 31 December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province in China. A previously unknown new virus was identified in January 2020, later named the 2019 novel coronavirus, and samples from cases and genetic analysis of the virus indicated this was the cause of the outbreak. This novel coronavirus was named by WHO in February 2020 as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus is known as SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease is COVID-19.	

## Kazakhstan
    
    Kazakhstan is a landlocked, transcontinental country located in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is bordered by China, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Turkmenistan. The terrain extends from the Caspian Sea to the Altay Mountains from west to east, and from the plains of Western Siberia to Central Asian deserts from north to south. The government system is a republic with a presidential authoritarian rule, and little power outside the executive branch. The chief of state is the president, and the prime minister is the head of government. Kazakhstan has a mixed economic system that includes a variety of private freedoms, combined with centralized economic planning and governance. Kazakhstan is a Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) member country.

## Climatic Condition

    Kazakhstan's territory stretches from west to east for more than 3000 km, and from north to south for nearly 2000 km. Climatic peculiarities are due to the country's vastness. Whereas in winter temperature in the north can hit 50 degrees below zero, in the summer melons in the south mature and cotton grow. Kazakhstan 's climate (excluding south) is sharply continental with average temperatures in January between -4 ° C and -19 ° C, and in July between +19 ... +26 ° C. Temperature may decrease to -45 ° C in winter and rise to +30, in summer.
             Cold winter begins in November, and continues until the end of April. Arctic air masses' influence leads to a strong cold (up to -50 ° C). Springs are short and variable-from the middle of April to the end of May. Besides the spring weather is very unstable: suddenly clear warm days can turn into cold. Dry hot summer begins at the end of May and lasts until mid-September, sometimes with temperatures going up to +35 ... +40 ° C. Autumn begins at the end of September with its stable weather and night frosts, and lasts until the beginning of November.

## Lockdown status of the country 
    
    Kazakhstan returned to a country-wide lockdown on July 5 as COVID-19 cases sprung up. The first lockdown of the country lasted from March 16th through May 11th. The second lockdown, which is scheduled to last at least two weeks, seems to be the world's first such reimposition of a nationwide lockdown.The two-week lockdown that could be extended if the virus continues to spread is restricting public gatherings and banning family and holiday gatherings. Citizens over 65 are expected to stay at home but others are allowed to practice alone outdoors.
    
    The number of cases of coronavirus in Kazakhstan has been increasing tenfold since the lifting of the first lockdown measures began. Kazakhstan had registered 5,207 cases of coronavirus and 32 deaths by May 11, the last day of state of emergency and lockdown. As of 13 July in the country there were 59,899 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 375 deaths. But the situation is rapidly evolving and could be a lot worse than this.

## Actions taken by the government
   
    Since the beginning of the pandemic, Kazakh authorities have taken a number of socio-economic measures. The country has had a state of emergency for about two months. Operations in Quarantine are ongoing. Despite the quarantine measures, however, the spread of the virus has recently been accelerating. The number of infected people already is around 20,000. Over a hundred people died of the disease. For people that's very worrying.          
    The epidemic did not go through government representatives at different levels.
    On 15 March Kazakhstan declared a state of emergency. Exports of some key food products were banned, while food and freight imports were maintained, and a food price cap was introduced. The Ministry of Agriculture lifted an existing ban on meat exports on 30 March, but introduced quotas for wheat and flour exports during quarantine periods. The government has closed all frontiers for non-citizens to enter, and has put air and rail traffic on hold. According to the national railway company, however, freight traffic with China and Russia has not been affected, suggesting some private enterprises continue to operate.

# 3. Comparison with several countries

### 3.1 Comparison with several neighboring countries

#### 3.1.1 Comparison with Russia and China

##### Confirmed cases

```{r}
confirmed_countries <- filter(coronavirus,country %in% c("Kazakhstan", "Russia", "China"))
```

```{r}
confiremed_corona_countries <- confirmed_countries %>% filter(type=="confirmed")
```

```{r}
ggplot(confiremed_corona_countries, aes(x=date, y=cases, col=country))+geom_line(size=1)+ ggtitle("Comparison confirmed cases with Russia and China")
```
  
  
    Although the time when the first active case was reported is the same, but the active cases reporting rate is very low compared to russia. Active cases report in China are lower in the end of march, therefore Kazakhstan active cases reports are slightly higher than China
   
##### Recovered cases

```{r}
recovered_corona_countries <- confirmed_countries %>% filter(type=="recovered")
```


```{r}
ggplot(recovered_corona_countries, aes(x=date, y=cases, col=country))+geom_line(size=1)+ ggtitle("Comparison recovered cases with Russia and China")
```
   
    As the number of patients in china decreases in the end of the March so the recovery rate of kazakhstan is slightly higher than China. But recovery rate in russia is much higher than kazakhstan because of the active cases were more higher number than kazakhstan.
    
#### Death cases

```{r}
death_corona_countries <- confirmed_countries %>% filter(type=="death")
```

```{r}
ggplot(death_corona_countries, aes(x=date, y=cases, col=country))+geom_line(size=1)+ ggtitle("Comparison death cases with Russia and China")
```


    The death toll in China was higher at the begining of the year and it decreased ath the end of the March. Deach cases in Kazakhstan and Russian have been reported since end of March, but Russia has a higher death rate than Kazakhstan.
    
### 3.2 Comparison with other countries

#### 3.2.1 Comparison with italy

```{r}
confirmed_countries1 <- filter(coronavirus,country %in% c("Kazakhstan", "Italy"))
```

##### Confirmed cases



```{r}
confiremed_corona_countries2 <- confirmed_countries1 %>% filter(type=="confirmed")
```



```{r}
ggplot(confiremed_corona_countries2, aes(x=date, y=cases, col=country))+geom_line(size=1)+ ggtitle("Comparison confirmed cases with Italy")
```
    
    
    active cases reporting in italy and kazakhstan began at the same time, but the incidence in Italy was much higher than in Kazakhstan.Active cases report in Italy have dropped slightly since early may.
    
#### Recoered cases

```{r}
recovered_corona_countries2 <- confirmed_countries1 %>% filter(type=="recovered")
```

```{r}
ggplot(recovered_corona_countries2, aes(x=date, y=cases, col=country))+geom_line(size=1)+ ggtitle("Comparison recovered cases with Italy")
```
   
    Italy's recovered rate was very high because of confirmed cases were high in italy
    
#### Death cases

```{r}
death_corona_countries2 <- confirmed_countries1 %>% filter(type=="death")
```

```{r}
ggplot(death_corona_countries2, aes(x=date, y=cases, col=country))+geom_line(size=1)+ ggtitle("Comparison death cases with Italy")
```


    Number of death was high in Italy because of the incidence of active cases is high.
    
### 3.3 Comparison with Sri Lanka

```{r}
population <- matrix(c(21.67, 18.28))
rownames(population)<- c("Sri Lanka", "Kazakhstan")
population

```

      we can see population of Sri lanka and population of Kazakstan are approximately the same, then we cn compare Kazakhstan with Sri Lanka
      
```{r}
confirmed_countries3 <- filter(coronavirus,country %in% c("Kazakhstan", "Sri Lanka"))
```

#### Confirmed cases
```{r}
confiremed_corona_countries3 <- confirmed_countries3 %>% filter(type=="confirmed")
```


```{r}
ggplot(confiremed_corona_countries3, aes(x=date, y=cases, col=country))+geom_line(size=1)+ ggtitle("Comparison confirmed cases with Sri Lanka")
```

    Reporting of Kazakhstan confirmed caser are much higher than Sri lanka.
    
    
#### Recovered cases

```{r}
recovered_corona_countries3 <- confirmed_countries3 %>% filter(type=="recovered")
```

```{r}
ggplot(recovered_corona_countries3, aes(x=date, y=cases, col=country))+geom_line(size=1)+ ggtitle("Comparison recovered cases with Sri Lanka")
```


    Becauce of the high number of confirmed cases kazakhstan recovered rat is high.
    
    
```{r}
death_corona_countries3 <- confirmed_countries3 %>% filter(type=="death")
```

```{r}
ggplot(death_corona_countries3, aes(x=date, y=cases, col=country))+geom_line(size=1)+ ggtitle("Comparison death cases with Sri Lanka")
```

## 4. Conclosion and Discussion

    (conclusions based on data set from 2020-01-22 to 2020-05-12)
    The covid-19 has been very well controlled inside the country.As we can see throgh the above graphs the death rate is very lower when comapred to the confirmed covid-19 cases.Furthermore, recovery rate also very high when compared with other countries.As we can see from the graphs, the reporting corona cases rate has started to gradually decrease in May
    When comparing kazakhastan with the neighboring countries such as Russia and China, the covid-19 cases were started to report in the middle of march in both Russia and Kazakhstan but Kazakhastan was able to control this pandemic better than Russia.Additionally, in China the the covid-19 cases reporing has decreased in the middle of march therefore,it is bit hard to compare this pandemic with a country as china.
    When comparing Kazakhstan with Italy, These two have same climate on early of the year till the April But the spred of the virus is much higher than Kazakhstan. So the death rate is very high in Italy.
    When the comparing Kazakhstan with Sri Lanka These two have approximatly the same population, the covid-19 cases were started to report in the middle of march in both Sri Lanka and Kazakhstan but Sri Lanka was able to control this pandemic better than Kazakhstan.
    
    
    Accordind to all of these dat, graphs and conclusions Kazakhstan was able to control this pandemic successfully till the 2020-05-12.
