# STA 326 2.0/ ASP 454 2.0 Programming and Data ANalysis with R

## Assignment 3 - 25 Marks


### Individual project: Coronavirus country report

We are still facing the global crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. As individuals we can do our part in keeping others safe by following the rules suggested by the government and WHO. As part of the data science community we can also provide our contribution, by analysing the data and helping to communicate it. Such type of support is high demand among government and related institutions. The purpose of this assignment is to fulfil that role.


The project represents 25% of your final grade for STA 326 2.0/ ASP 454 2.0.

### 1. Guidelines

I have assigned a country for each of you. You need to write a report by analysing coronavirus data of the country that I have assigned. The report should be written in Rmarkdown and the output format should be HTML. All your reports will be published on the course website here: https://hellor.netlify.app

In order to view name of the country corresponds to your index number use the steps give below:

**Step 1**

Install `devtools` package.

**Step 2**

Type the following code to get access to the `sta3262` package. This package provides a function to view the country. Please note that you may have  `sta3262` already installed in to your machine. However, you should reinstall `sta3262` in order to get access to the assignment 3.

```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("thiyangt/sta3262")

```

**Step 3**

Load the `sta3262` using the command

```{r, comment=NA}
library(sta3262)
```


**Step 4**

To view your country, 

```{r, comment=NA}
get_individual_project_country("AS2018000") # type your index n. within ""
```

**Please send me an email if your index number is not in the list or if the function outputs** character(0).
